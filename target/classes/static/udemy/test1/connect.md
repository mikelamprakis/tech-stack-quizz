A company needs to filter out sensitive data from logs before storing it in a database using Kafka Connect. Which Kafka Connect feature should be utilized to achieve this?

Kafka Streams API.

Stream joins.

Schema management.

Your answer is correct
Single Message Transforms (SMTs).

Overall explanation
Single Message Transforms (SMTs) in Kafka Connect allow for the modification of records as they pass through the pipeline, suitable for tasks like filtering sensitive data.

You are setting up a Kafka Connect pipeline to integrate data between Kafka and several external systems. What is the difference between source and sink connectors in Kafka Connect, and how should you use them?

Your answer is correct
Source connectors write data to Kafka, while sink connectors read from Kafka.

There is no difference; both are used interchangeably.

Source connectors read data from Kafka, while sink connectors write to Kafka.

Both types of connectors can read and write to Kafka simultaneously.

Overall explanation
Source connectors import data from external systems into Kafka topics, allowing Kafka to consume data from various sources. Sink connectors export data from Kafka topics to external systems, enabling data distribution to downstream applications. Each type plays a distinct role in data integration, ensuring efficient data flow between Kafka and other systems.

If a Kafka Connect sink connector encounters persistent write errors to an external database, what error handling strategies should be configured to maintain data integrity?

Ignore errors and continue.

Your selection is correct
Use a dead letter queue to handle failures.

Log the errors and halt the system.

Correct selection
Retry the operation with exponential backoff.

Overall explanation
Implementing robust error handling strategies such as retries with backoff and configuring a dead letter queue can help manage errors effectively, ensuring that data integrity is maintained even in the face of persistent errors.

Why are Config Definitions important in Kafka Connect?

(Select all that apply)

Your selection is incorrect
They dictate the security protocols used by connectors.

Your selection is correct
They define the required and optional settings for each connector.

Correct selection
They provide default values for connector configurations.

Your selection is incorrect
They help manage connector scalability and performance.

Overall explanation
Config Definitions in Kafka Connect are critical because they specify what settings are available for each connector, including required and optional parameters, and provide default values that help streamline connector setup. This ensures that connectors are configured properly to operate effectively and securely within a Kafka ecosystem​​.

Consider the following Java code snippet for defining a Kafka Connector Schema. Identify the issue in the code and explain how to fix it.



public static Schema USER_SCHEMA = SchemaBuilder.struct()
.name(SCHEMA_VALUE_USER)
.version(1)
.field(USER_WEBSITE_FIELD, Schema.STRING)
.field(USER_ID_FIELD, Schema.INT32)
.field(USER_NAME_FIELD, Schema.STRING)
.build();
Your answer is correct
The Schema.STRING and Schema.INT32 should be replaced with Schema.STRING_SCHEMA and Schema.INT32_SCHEMA, respectively.

The USER_ID_FIELD should use Schema.INT64 instead of Schema.INT32.

The version method should not be used in the schema definition.

Overall explanation
The issue in the provided Java code snippet is that the schema types Schema.STRING and Schema.INT32 are incorrectly specified. They should be replaced with Schema.STRING_SCHEMA and Schema.INT32_SCHEMA, respectively. The corrected schema definition should be:



public static Schema USER_SCHEMA = SchemaBuilder.struct()
.name(SCHEMA_VALUE_USER)
.version(1)
.field(USER_WEBSITE_FIELD, Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
.field(USER_ID_FIELD, Schema.INT32_SCHEMA)
.field(USER_NAME_FIELD, Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
.build();

What are key considerations when configuring Kafka Connect?

(Select all that apply)

Your selection is correct
Setting up connection details for the source or sink system.

Assigning consumer groups for data processing.

Correct selection
Configuring topics for data flow.

Your selection is correct
Choosing the right connector plugins.

Overall explanation
Proper configuration of Kafka Connect involves selecting appropriate connector plugins, setting up connection details, and configuring topics to ensure efficient and correct data flow.

What are the main differences between Standalone and Distributed modes in Kafka Connect?

Distributed mode is not scalable, while Standalone mode is highly scalable.

Your answer is correct
Standalone mode uses a single process, while Distributed mode uses multiple workers.

Standalone mode supports fault tolerance, whereas Distributed mode does not.

Configuration in Standalone mode is done via REST API, unlike in Distributed mode.

Overall explanation
Standalone mode is simple and suitable for development and testing as it runs connectors and tasks within a single process with bundled configuration. Distributed mode, suitable for production, uses multiple workers and is scalable and fault-tolerant with configuration managed via a REST API.

What are the fundamental components of Kafka Connect?

Your selection is correct
Workers

Your selection is correct
Tasks

Consumers

Your selection is correct
Connectors

Overall explanation
Kafka Connect is built on three main components: Connectors, which are reusable Java JARs configured by users; Tasks, which handle data import/export; and Workers, Java processes that execute tasks either standalone or clustered.
