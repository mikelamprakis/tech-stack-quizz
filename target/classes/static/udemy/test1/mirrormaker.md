A company needs to ensure data availability despite regional outages. Which Kafka feature should they prioritize implementing?

Enhanced topic configuration

Your answer is correct
Geographical data replication using MirrorMaker 2.0

Local log compaction

Intra-cluster replication

Overall explanation
In disaster recovery scenarios, using MirrorMaker 2.0 to replicate data to a geographically distant cluster is crucial. This ensures data availability and supports failover and failback procedures in case of regional outages.

What are failover and failback procedures in Kafka, and how does MirrorMaker 2.0 support them?

Methods for rebalancing partitions among brokers

Correct answer
Mechanisms for switching between primary and replica clusters during outages

Your answer is incorrect
Techniques for managing consumer offset commits

Procedures to restart Kafka brokers automatically

Overall explanation
Failover involves switching to a replica cluster when the primary cluster fails, and failback is the return to the primary cluster once it is restored. MirrorMaker 2.0 supports these procedures through consistent replication and offset management, facilitating smooth transitions without data loss.
