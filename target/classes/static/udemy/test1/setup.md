You are developing a disaster recovery plan for a Kafka deployment that needs to ensure data availability and reliability during outages. What considerations are crucial for effective disaster recovery planning in Kafka?

Ensuring all data is stored in a single location.

Prioritizing low-cost storage solutions.

Your answer is correct
Replicating data across multiple data centers or availability zones.

Focusing solely on backup frequency.

Overall explanation
Disaster recovery planning for Kafka should include strategies to replicate data across multiple locations to ensure availability during outages. This involves setting up replication across multiple data centers or availability zones, backing up critical metadata, and regularly testing failover and failback procedures to ensure reliability. This approach helps maintain data integrity and accessibility even in the event of a disaster.

Select all strategies that are essential for effectively scaling Kafka data pipelines:

Your selection is correct
Increasing the number of partitions to enable better parallelism.

Your selection is correct
Employing a distributed Kafka Streams approach.

Your selection is incorrect
Integrating Kafka with scalable external storage systems.

Utilizing data compaction to reduce the data footprint.

Overall explanation
Effective scaling of Kafka data pipelines can be achieved by:

Using Kafka Streams, which allows for distributed stream processing, enhancing the capability to handle large data volumes through parallel processing.

Increasing the number of partitions enhances parallelism, allowing more consumers to process data concurrently, thereby improving throughput and reducing processing time​​.
