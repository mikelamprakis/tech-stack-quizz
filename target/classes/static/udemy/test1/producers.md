Question 5:
You have a Kafka producer that needs to ensure maximum data safety during transmission. What configuration should you set to achieve this?

Increase buffer.memory and batch.size.

Decrease linger.ms to zero.

Use only synchronous sends.

Your answer is correct
Set acks to 'all' and enable idempotence.

Overall explanation
For maximum data safety, setting acks to 'all' ensures that all in-sync replicas acknowledge message receipts, and enabling idempotence prevents data duplication, thereby safeguarding against data loss.

Question 10:
Imagine you are configuring a Kafka producer for an application that experiences high data generation rates during peak hours. How should you configure the max.block.ms and buffer.memory settings to ensure smooth operation during these periods?

(Select all that apply)

Your selection is correct
Set max.block.ms to a higher value

Reduce max.block.ms

Your selection is correct
Increase buffer.memory

Decrease buffer.memory

Overall explanation
During periods of high data generation, increasing buffer.memory allows the producer to hold more data temporarily when the broker's acceptance rate cannot keep up, reducing the risk of overrunning the buffer. Additionally, configuring a longer max.block.ms helps the producer handle data bursts more gracefully by extending the time it will wait before timing out, thus reducing the chances of data loss and application errors due to blocked sends. This setup is critical in managing data flow efficiently under variable network conditions and system loads.

How can you configure a Kafka producer for low latency message delivery?

Your answer is correct
Reduce linger.ms to 0 and use a smaller batch.size.

Increase linger.ms to the maximum possible value.

Set batch.size to its maximum to ensure large batch processing.

Disable all acknowledgements with acks set to '0'.

Overall explanation
For low latency message delivery, minimizing linger.ms helps send messages immediately without waiting to batch, and a smaller batch.size ensures that messages are sent as soon as they are available, both reducing delivery delay.

What is the primary benefit of enabling idempotent producers in Kafka?

They decrease the load on ZooKeeper.

Your answer is correct
They prevent message duplication in the event of network errors and retries.

They increase the message transmission speed.

They allow for higher compression of messages.

Overall explanation
Idempotent producers ensure that messages are delivered exactly once to a partition, even if the producer sends the same message multiple times due to retries, thus preventing duplicates​​.

What is the purpose of callbacks in Kafka producers?

To notify producers when consumers retrieve messages.

To schedule future messages based on consumer feedback.

To encrypt messages after they are sent.

Your answer is correct
To execute code asynchronously upon the successful or failed delivery of a message, enabling applications to react accordingly.

Overall explanation
Callbacks in Kafka producers allow developers to handle the result of message delivery, whether successful or failed, enabling dynamic responses within the application.

What does the request.timeout.ms setting control in Kafka producers?

The expiration time of a message in the queue.

The interval at which requests are retried.

The time Kafka stores unacknowledged messages.

Your answer is correct
The duration Kafka will wait for a broker response to a request.

Overall explanation
The request.timeout.ms setting determines how long the producer waits for a response from the broker after sending data. This helps manage the behavior during network issues or broker failures.

What does the producer property batch.size signify in Kafka?

Your answer is correct
The maximum number of bytes that can be included in a batch of records for the same partition.

The maximum time in milliseconds to wait before sending a batch of records.

The maximum number of records that can be produced per second.

The maximum number of partitions that a producer can write to simultaneously.

Overall explanation
The batch.size property in Kafka producers defines the maximum number of bytes that can be included in a batch of records for the same partition. This setting optimizes the number of requests sent by batching together smaller messages to create fewer, larger requests. Messages that exceed this size will not be batched. Note that a single request can contain multiple batches if data is being sent to multiple partitions. This helps in reducing network overhead and improving throughput efficiency.

What are the trade-offs involved in compressing messages in Kafka?

Compression reduces latency but increases CPU usage.

Compression increases both throughput and storage usage.

Your answer is correct
Compression reduces network and storage usage but increases CPU overhead.

Compression affects message ordering but enhances security.

Overall explanation
Compressing messages can significantly improve network and storage efficiency but requires additional CPU resources for compression and decompression processes.

Which timestamps are maintained within Kafka messages?

AppendTime

Your selection is correct
LogAppendTime

Correct selection
CreateTime

ReadTime

Overall explanation
CreateTime is set by the producer when the message is created, reflecting the production time. LogAppendTime is set by the broker when the message is appended to the log, used for operations like log retention and message ordering.
