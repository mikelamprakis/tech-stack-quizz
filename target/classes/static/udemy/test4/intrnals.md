How is leadership determined in ZooKeeper, and what are the roles of the leader and followers?

(Select all that apply)

Followers only handle write requests when the leader is unavailable.

Your selection is correct
Followers handle read requests, providing scalability and distributing the read load.

Your selection is correct
The leader handles all write operations to ensure consistency and reliability.

The leader and followers both handle write operations to balance the load.

Overall explanation
ZooKeeper operates with a leadership model where one server acts as the leader, handling all write operations to ensure consistency and reliability. The other servers function as followers, handling read requests, which provides scalability and distributes the read load across the cluster. Followers do not handle write requests; write operations are coordinated through a single point to maintain consistency in the distributed environment.
