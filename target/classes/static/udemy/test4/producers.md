What is the significance of the delivery.timeout.ms setting for Kafka producers?

It defines the duration between message production and consumption.

It sets the time interval for retries after the first delivery attempt fails.

Your answer is correct
It specifies how long to wait for a message to be delivered before it is considered failed.

It controls how long the broker retains a message before it is delivered.

Overall explanation
The delivery.timeout.ms setting defines the total duration the producer will wait for a message delivery attempt, including retries, before considering it a failure, ensuring messages don't get stuck indefinitely.

Consider the following Java code snippet configuring a Kafka producer for high throughput. Identify the issue in the code and explain how to fix it.



Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty(ProducerConfig.COMPRESSION_TYPE_CONFIG, "snappy");
properties.setProperty(ProducerConfig.LINGER_MS_CONFIG, "20");
properties.setProperty(ProducerConfig.BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG, "32*1024");
Your answer is incorrect
The COMPRESSION_TYPE_CONFIG should be set to gzip for better performance.

Correct answer
The BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG should be set using Integer.toString(32 * 1024) instead of "32*1024".

The LINGER_MS_CONFIG value should be increased to 100 for better batching.

The code snippet is correct; no changes are needed.

Overall explanation
The issue in the provided code snippet is with the BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG property. The value is incorrectly set as the string "32*1024" instead of the evaluated integer value. It should be set using Integer.toString(32 * 1024) to correctly configure the batch size in bytes:

properties.setProperty(ProducerConfig.BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG,
Integer.toString(32 * 1024));
This ensures that the Kafka producer correctly interprets the batch size configuration. The rest of the settings are appropriate for configuring a high throughput producer.

How do Kafka producers handle failures when sending messages?

By redirecting messages to a backup server.

By automatically deleting failed messages.

By pausing message production until the failure is resolved.

Your answer is correct
By retrying sending messages automatically based on the retries and retry.backoff.ms configurations or by catching exceptions to handle failures manually.

Overall explanation
Kafka producers can handle sending failures by automatically retrying as configured or programmatically managing exceptions to ensure robust message delivery.

Imagine you are configuring a Kafka producer for a critical financial transaction system where data loss cannot be tolerated. How should you configure the producer's acks and min.insync.replicas settings to maximize data reliability and durability? Select all applicable scenarios:

Your selection is correct
Set acks=all to ensure that all in-sync replicas acknowledge the receipt of messages.

Your selection is correct
Configure min.insync.replicas=3 to require acknowledgments from two additional replicas besides the leader.

Configure min.insync.replicas=1 to allow quick writes with minimal replication.

Set acks=1 to wait for only the leader's acknowledgment, optimizing for lower latency.

Overall explanation
In a critical system where data loss is unacceptable, setting acks=all ensures that a message is only considered successfully written if all in-sync replicas have acknowledged receipt. This maximizes the reliability of message writes. Additionally, configuring min.insync.replicas to a higher number like 3 increases the durability by requiring more replicas to store the message before it's considered successfully written, further safeguarding against data loss in the event of a replica failure.

You are configuring a Kafka producer for an e-commerce application where it is critical to avoid message duplication, ensuring that each order is processed exactly once. What strategies can be employed to achieve this?

(Select all that apply)

Decrease the timeout settings.

Your selection is correct
Use transactional APIs.

Increase the number of retries.

Your selection is correct
Enable idempotent producers.

Overall explanation
To prevent message duplication in Kafka producers, you can enable idempotent producers and use transactional APIs. Idempotent producers ensure that each message is written exactly once, even if retries occur. Transactional APIs allow you to group multiple operations into a single transaction, ensuring atomicity and preventing duplication by ensuring messages are written exactly once to a Kafka topic.

What should be considered when configuring message retries in Kafka producers?

(Select all that apply)

Network bandwidth consumption

Your selection is incorrect
Storage limits on brokers

Your selection is correct
Potential for message duplication

Your selection is correct
Message order

Overall explanation
When configuring retries, it is important to consider the potential for message duplication and impacts on message ordering. Settings like enabling idempotence and managing max.in.flight.requests.per.connection can help mitigate these issues.

How does the max.in.flight.requests.per.connection setting impact the reliability and throughput of Kafka producers?

It limits the throughput by decreasing the number of simultaneous requests allowed.

It enhances reliability by reducing the number of requests any single broker must handle.

Your answer is correct
It increases throughput by allowing more simultaneous requests, but can risk message order in case of retries.

It prioritizes older messages over newer ones to maintain order.

Overall explanation
The max.in.flight.requests.per.connection setting controls how many requests can be sent to the server without awaiting an acknowledgment. Increasing this value can improve throughput; however, if retries occur, it may affect the ordering of messages​​.
