You are developing a Kafka Streams application and need to configure the default serializers and deserializers (SerDes) for your streams. What are the default SerDes provided by Kafka Streams?

The default SerDes are StringSerDe and IntegerSerDe, making it easy to handle basic data types.

The default SerDes are JSONSerDe and XMLSerDe, ensuring compatibility with common data formats.

Your answer is correct
The Serdes specified in the Streams configuration are used as the default

The default SerDes are configured automatically based on the data schema, ensuring seamless data processing.

Overall explanation
Serdes specified in the Streams configuration are used as the default in your Kafka Streams application. Because this config's default is null, you must either set a default Serde by using this configuration or pass in Serdes explicitly.

What are the error handling strategies available in Kafka Streams?

Fail-fast

Your answer is correct
All of the above

Log-and-continue

Custom exception handling

Overall explanation
Kafka Streams supports several error handling strategies including failing fast on errors, logging errors and continuing, and implementing custom exception handling to ensure robust and continuous operation despite errors.

Given this Kafka Streams operation, what does the Peek function do?



KStream<String, String> processed = stream.peek((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + ": " + value));

Your answer is correct
Outputs each record to the console without altering the stream.

Filters and returns a new stream with altered records.

Generates a new key for each record.

Modifies the values based on a condition.

Overall explanation
The Peek function is used to perform a side-effect operation (like logging or debugging outputs to the console) on a stream without changing the records themselves​​.

What is the primary use of a Sliding Time Window in Kafka Streams?

To aggregate events into non-overlapping time blocks.

To handle time intervals with gaps in event data.

To manage windows based on session activity.

Your answer is correct
To analyze events within a specific period around each event.

Overall explanation
A Sliding Time Window in Kafka Streams is used to analyze events within a specific duration before and after each event's timestamp, such as 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after, providing a dynamic view of the data that adapts based on the occurrence of events​​.

How does Kafka Streams differ from other streaming frameworks like Spark Streaming and Flink?

Uses micro-batch processing for streaming

Your answer is correct
Supports exactly-once processing semantics without a separate cluster

Offers only at-least-once processing guarantees

Requires a separate cluster for deployment

Overall explanation
Kafka Streams processes data in true real-time and does not require a separate processing cluster, unlike other frameworks that might use micro-batches or need dedicated infrastructure.

In Kafka Streams, which operations mark the stream for re-partitioning?

(Select all that apply)

mapValues

flatMap

Correct selection
groupBy

Your selection is correct
selectKey

Overall explanation
In Kafka Streams, the operations selectKey and groupBy often lead to re-partitioning. selectKey is used to change the key of stream records, which may necessitate re-partitioning to maintain key-based ordering. Similarly, groupBy changes the key used for aggregation, also typically triggering re-partitioning​​.

What are the core capabilities of Kafka Streams?

Limited to simple data processing.

Your answer is correct
Data transformation and enrichment.

Transaction management only.

Only supports exactly-once processing.

Overall explanation
Kafka Streams is a robust library for data processing and transformation within the Kafka ecosystem, supporting data transformations, enrichment, complex event processing, and features such as exactly-once processing, making it highly suitable for real-time applications.

What are essential components that support stateful processing in Kafka Streams?

(Select all that apply)

Your selection is correct
State stores

Your selection is correct
Changelog topics

Interactive queries

KSQL server

Overall explanation
State stores in Kafka Streams facilitate stateful processing by maintaining local storage backed by a RocksDB database, while changelog topics provide durability and enable recovery​​.

How does Kafka Streams handle late-arriving data in windowed operations?

None of the above

By increasing the window size automatically

Your answer is correct
By allowing a grace period for late data to be included

By discarding late data immediately

Overall explanation
Kafka Streams handles late-arriving data by providing a configurable grace period during which late data can still be included in windowed aggregations, ensuring more accurate and comprehensive data processing.
