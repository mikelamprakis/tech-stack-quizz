What features contribute to achieving Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS) in Kafka?

(Select all that apply)

Your selection is correct
Idempotent producers that eliminate the risk of duplicating messages due to retries.

Log compaction to ensure only the latest message is retained per key.

Your selection is correct
Transactional APIs that ensure atomicity across multiple partitions and topics.

Consumer group coordination to manage delivery status collectively.

Overall explanation
Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS) in Kafka is achieved by using idempotent producers, which prevent duplicates by managing sequence numbers for messages, and transactional APIs, which group multiple message actions into atomic transactions.This combination ensures that messages are processed exactly once, addressing challenges related to message duplication and missing data in failure scenarios​​.
