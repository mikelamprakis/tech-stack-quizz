You are tasked with optimizing a Kafka cluster that experiences frequent, lengthy garbage collection pauses. What strategies would you employ?

Upgrade the network infrastructure

Increase the number of Kafka brokers

Your answer is correct
Adjust the GC algorithm and JVM heap settings

Decrease the amount of data processed

Overall explanation
Adjusting the garbage collection (GC) algorithm and JVM heap settings are effective strategies for reducing frequent and lengthy GC pauses. Selecting a modern GC algorithm like G1GC and fine-tuning JVM parameters such as heap sizes can help minimize disruption and enhance overall performance.

How much JVM memory is typically sufficient for a Kafka broker?

Your answer is incorrect
1GB to 2GB

Correct answer
4GB to 6GB

2GB to 3GB

8GB to 10GB

Overall explanation
For a standard Kafka broker deployment, it is recommended to allocate between 4GB to 6GB of heap space for the JVM. This allocation may need to be adjusted depending on the specific workload, data volume, and performance metrics observed.

What is a ZooKeeper quorum, and why is it critical for a Kafka deployment?

A security feature that encrypts data between Kafka and ZooKeeper.

Your answer is correct
A majority of nodes in a ZooKeeper ensemble required to agree on updates.

A special network configuration that enhances ZooKeeper's performance.

A backup system that takes over if the primary ZooKeeper fails.

Overall explanation
A ZooKeeper quorum is critical for Kafka's distributed coordination as it ensures consistent metadata management and fault tolerance across the Kafka cluster.
