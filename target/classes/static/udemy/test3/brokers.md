You are tuning a Kafka broker to handle an increased load of network requests efficiently. What role does the num.network.threads configuration play in Kafka's performance?

Your answer is correct
It controls the number of threads dedicated to handling network requests.

It dictates the number of threads used for disk I/O operations.

It manages the distribution of data across network channels.

It sets the maximum number of network connections that can be handled simultaneously.

Overall explanation
The num.network.threads setting is crucial for optimizing Kafka's throughput and handling peak loads by specifying the number of threads used for processing network requests. Adjusting this parameter helps ensure that the broker can efficiently manage incoming and outgoing network traffic, thereby improving overall performance and responsiveness.

What is the significance of the min.insync.replicas setting in a Kafka environment?

Your answer is incorrect
It specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a read operation before it is considered successful.

Correct answer
It sets the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write operation for it to be considered successful.

It controls the number of replica fetches that can fail before causing a broker shutdown.

It determines the number of replicas that can be out of sync before the leader is re-elected.

Overall explanation
The min.insync.replicas setting ensures data durability and high availability by requiring a minimum number of in-sync replicas to acknowledge a write operation before it is considered successful.

What is a preferred leader in Kafka?

Your answer is correct
The broker that was the leader of a partition at the time the topic was created, ensuring initial load distribution remains balanced.

The broker with the highest throughput, ensuring maximum performance.

The broker with the least network latency, ensuring quick data retrieval.

The broker that has the most storage capacity available, ensuring efficient data storage.

Overall explanation
In Kafka, the preferred leader is the broker that was the leader of a partition at the time the topic was created. This broker is considered preferred for leadership because the initial allocation of leader roles among brokers is balanced.

What are the implications of under-replicated partitions in Kafka, and how should they be addressed?

Your selection is correct
They decrease data durability.

Correct selection
They should be addressed by resolving network issues or broker failures.

Correct selection
They may cause data loss.

They are a normal part of Kafka operations.

Overall explanation
Under-replicated partitions occur when some replicas do not have the current data, affecting data durability and increasing the risk of data loss. Addressing them typically involves identifying and resolving issues such as broker failures or network problems to ensure all replicas are synchronized.
