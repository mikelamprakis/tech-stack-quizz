- D. To set the location of the client certificate for authentication  
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `ssl.client.auth` configuration controls whether Kafka brokers require clients to authenticate with SSL certificates.  
Valid values are:
- `none`: No client authentication
- `requested`: Clients may provide certificates, but they are not required
- `required`: Clients **must** provide a certificate for authentication

This is crucial for securing Kafka clusters using mutual TLS.
```

</details>

---

## Question 20

```markdown
What happens when `ssl.client.auth` is set to `required` in the Kafka broker configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Clients are required to provide a valid certificate for authentication  
- B. Clients can choose to provide a certificate optionally  
- C. Client authentication is disabled, and no certificates are requested  
- D. The broker uses the default SSL/TLS protocol version for client authentication  
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
When `ssl.client.auth` is set to `required`, all clients must present a valid SSL certificate during the handshake.  
The broker will verify the client certificate against its truststore.  
If the certificate is missing or invalid, the connection is rejected.  
This is how you enforce mutual TLS in Kafka.
```

</details>

---

## Question 21

```markdown
What is the default value of the `ssl.client.auth` configuration in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `none`

- D. `optional`  
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The default value of `ssl.client.auth` is `none`.  
This means Kafka brokers do not request or require client certificates by default.  
To enable authentication, this must be set to either `requested` or `required`.
```
