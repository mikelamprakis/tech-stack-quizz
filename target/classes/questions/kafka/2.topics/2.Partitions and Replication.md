## Question 8

```markdown
A Kafka producer is configured to use the `acks=all` setting while publishing messages to a topic partition that has a replication factor of 3. The topic is also configured with `min.insync.replicas=2`. Broker A hosts the current leader for this partition, while Brokers B and C host the replicas. Due to unforeseen circumstances, both Broker B and Broker C go offline simultaneously. What is the impact on the producer's ability to successfully publish messages to this partition?

```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will be able to publish messages, but with potential data loss.
- B. The producer will temporarily be unable to publish messages until at least one replica broker comes back online.
- C. The producer will continue to publish messages successfully without any impact.
- D. The producer will immediately switch to another topic's partition that has all replicas available.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
With `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=2`, the producer needs acknowledgments from the leader plus at least one ISR replica. If both replicas go offline, ISR count drops below 2, so the producer cannot publish until a replica rejoins.

- A. False — no publishing possible, not just data loss.
- B. Correct — producer blocks until ISR recovers.
- C. False — publishing is impacted.
- D. False — producer doesn't switch partitions automatically.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
A Kafka cluster has the following configuration:

`unclean.leader.election.enable=false`

What is the implication of this setting when a partition leader fails and there are no in-sync replicas (ISRs) available?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The partition will remain unavailable until the failed leader recovers.
- B. The partition will elect a new leader from the out-of-sync replicas to maintain availability.
- C. The partition will automatically create a new replica to replace the failed leader.
- D. The partition will be reassigned to another broker in the cluster.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
When `unclean.leader.election.enable=false`, Kafka disallows election of a leader from out-of-sync replicas.  
So if no ISR is available after leader failure, the partition remains unavailable to preserve data consistency.

- A. Correct — partition remains unavailable until original leader recovers.
- B. Incorrect — election from out-of-sync replicas is disabled.
- C. Incorrect — Kafka does not create replicas automatically.
- D. Incorrect — partition is not reassigned automatically.
```

## Question 12

```markdown
A Kafka cluster is configured with:

`default.replication.factor=2`  
`min.insync.replicas=2`

What is the minimum number of brokers required to tolerate one failure and still serve write requests?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 3
- D. 4
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`min.insync.replicas=2` means two replicas must acknowledge writes.  
To tolerate one broker failure while maintaining two in-sync replicas, you need **3 brokers** in total.

- A. Incorrect — one broker cannot meet insync requirements.
- B. Incorrect — two brokers cannot tolerate one failure and still maintain 2 ISRs.
- C. Correct — three brokers allow one failure and 2 ISRs remain.
- D. Incorrect — more than needed.
```

## Question 17

```markdown
Which of the following statements about `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` are true? (Select all that apply)
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `acks` is a producer configuration, while `min.insync.replicas` is a topic configuration
- B. `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` are both producer configurations
- C. `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` are both topic configurations
- D. `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=1` provides the strongest durability guarantee
- E. `acks=1` and `min.insync.replicas=2` provides the strongest durability guarantee
- F. For `acks=all` to provide any additional durability over `acks=1`, `min.insync.replicas` must be greater than 1
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A, F

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Correct: `acks` is a producer config; `min.insync.replicas` is a topic config.
- F. Correct: `acks=all` only provides better durability than `acks=1` if `min.insync.replicas > 1`.
- B, C. Incorrect, they are configs at different levels.
- D. Incorrect, with `min.insync.replicas=1`, `acks=all` is no stronger than `acks=1`.
- E. Incorrect, this combination does not provide the strongest durability.
```

## Question 18

```markdown
In a Kafka cluster, you have a topic with 6 partitions and a replication factor of 3. How many replicas of each partition will be spread across the brokers?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1 replica per broker
- B. 2 replicas per broker
- C. 3 replicas per broker
- D. 6 replicas per broker
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Each partition has 3 replicas:

- 1 leader + 2 followers.
- For 6 partitions × 3 replicas = 18 replicas total.
- These are spread across brokers for redundancy.

Kafka ensures load balancing but the number of replicas per broker depends on the cluster size.
```

## Question 19

```markdown
In a Kafka cluster, you have a topic with 6 partitions and a replication factor of 3. How many replicas of each partition will be spread across the brokers?

- A. 1 replica per broker
- B. 2 replicas per broker
- C. 3 replicas per broker
- D. 6 replicas per broker
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1 replica per broker
- B. 2 replicas per broker
- C. 3 replicas per broker
- D. 6 replicas per broker
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Each partition has 3 replicas:

- A. 1 replica per broker – ❌ Not accurate for replication factor 3.
- B. 2 replicas per broker – ❌ Underreplicated.
- C. 3 replicas per broker – ✅ Each of the 6 partitions has 3 replicas (18 total).
- D. 6 replicas per broker – ❌ Misrepresents Kafka's replication mechanism.
```

## Question 1

```markdown
You are managing a Kafka cluster that handles a growing volume of transaction data. To accommodate the increased data load and improve consumer performance, you decide to adjust the number of partitions for an existing topic. What changes can you make to the number of partitions, and what limitations should you be aware of?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. You cannot change the number of partitions for an existing topic once it has been set.
- B. You can increase the number of partitions to scale up and accommodate more data or consumers, but you cannot decrease the number of partitions once set.
- C. You can increase the number of partitions, and if needed, decrease them later to optimize performance.
- D. You can decrease the number of partitions to consolidate data and improve performance but cannot increase them.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In Kafka, you can increase partitions for scaling but cannot decrease them after creation.

- A. Incorrect: Partitions can be increased.
- B. Correct: Increasing partitions is allowed; decreasing is not.
- C. Incorrect: Decreasing partitions is impossible.
- D. Incorrect: Increasing is possible; decreasing is not.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
You are considering increasing the number of partitions for an existing Kafka topic to improve throughput. What impact will this have on message distribution and consumer logic?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Increasing partitions will change the hashing mechanism for message keys, which can disrupt the guarantee that the same keys always go to the same partition.
- B. Increasing partitions will have no impact on existing message distribution or consumer logic.
- C. Increasing partitions will automatically rebalance the consumer group, ensuring each consumer receives an equal number of partitions.
- D. Increasing partitions will redistribute existing messages across the new partitions, ensuring balanced load distribution.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Partition increases affect key hashing.

- A. Correct: Key-to-partition mapping changes.
- B. Incorrect: Distribution logic is affected.
- C. Incorrect: Rebalancing occurs but doesn't guarantee equal distribution.
- D. Incorrect: Existing messages aren't redistributed.
```
