## Question 18

```markdown
How does Kafka Streams handle state recovery in case of a failure?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. By replaying all the input messages from the beginning
- B. By restoring the state from a snapshot stored in Kafka
- C. By rebuilding the state from the change log topic
- D. By retrieving the state from an external database

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams provides built-in fault tolerance and state recovery mechanisms to handle failures and ensure the integrity of the processing state. When a failure occurs, Kafka Streams automatically recovers the state using the change log topic.

Here's how state recovery works in Kafka Streams:

1. Change Log Topic: For each state store in a Kafka Streams application, Kafka Streams creates a corresponding change log topic. The change log topic acts as a persistent log of all the state changes that occurred in the state store.

2. State Updates: Whenever the state in a state store is updated as a result of processing messages, Kafka Streams writes the state changes to the change log topic. Each record in the change log topic represents a state update and includes the key, value, and timestamp of the update.

3. Failure Recovery: If a failure occurs and a Kafka Streams application needs to recover its state, it starts by reading the change log topic from the beginning. The application replays the state changes from the change log topic to rebuild the state store. By replaying the state changes in the correct order, the application can restore its state to the latest consistent point before the failure.

4. Resuming Processing: Once the state is recovered from the change log topic, the Kafka Streams application can resume processing from the point where it left off. It continues to read input messages from the source topics and applies the processing logic to update the state and generate output.

- B. leveraging the change log topic, Kafka Streams ensures that the state can be recovered accurately and efficiently in case of failures. The change log topic acts as a durable and replicated log of state changes, providing a reliable source of truth for state recovery.

It's important to note that Kafka Streams does not rely on replaying all the input messages from the beginning or storing snapshots of the state in Kafka itself. The change log topic is specifically designed to capture and persist the state changes, enabling quick and precise state recovery.

Additionally, Kafka Streams does not rely on external databases for state storage or recovery. The state is managed internally within Kafka Streams using the embedded key-value stores and the change log topics.

### Question 1

```markdown
What mechanism does Kafka Streams use to recover state after a failure?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Transactional producer retries
- B. Checkpoint files in local storage
- C. Changelog topics for state stores
- D. MirrorMaker replication
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Changelog topics store all updates to state stores so they can be rebuilt after a crash.

- A. Not related to state recovery.
- B. No checkpoints are used in this way.
- C. Correct.
- D. Used for cross-cluster replication, not Streams recovery.
```

### Question 2

```markdown
Which of the following is stored in the RocksDB state store's changelog topic?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Only compacted tombstones
- B. The full value of each key change
- C. Aggregated metrics
- D. Task assignment metadata
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams writes every update to a key in a changelog topic to enable full state recovery.

- A. Tombstones are for deletes, not the only thing stored.
- B. Correct.
- C. Metrics are not in changelogs.
- D. Task assignment is part of internal coordination.
```

### Question 3

```markdown
What happens when a Kafka Streams instance fails?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Kafka automatically restores from a snapshot
- B. The affected partitions are reassigned to other instances
- C. Consumers are blocked until the app restarts
- D. The whole Streams application stops
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams relies on Kafka’s consumer group mechanism, so if one instance fails, others pick up its partitions.

- A. Snapshots are not used.
- B. Correct.
- C. Kafka rebalances.
- D. Only the failed instance stops.
```

### Question 4

```markdown
How does Kafka Streams ensure exactly-once processing in case of failure?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Disabling auto commit
- B. Using idempotent producers and transactions
- C. Syncing the state store to a file
- D. Restoring messages manually from DLQ
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams uses Kafka’s idempotent producer + transactional APIs for EOS (Exactly Once Semantics).

- A. Helps, but not sufficient.
- B. Correct.
- C. Not applicable.
- D. Streams doesn’t use DLQs directly.
```

</details>

### Question 5

```markdown
Which configuration enables exactly-once semantics in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `processing.guarantee=exactly_once_v2`
- B. `acks=all`
- C. `auto.offset.reset=latest`
- D. `max.poll.records=1`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams supports `exactly_once` and `exactly_once_v2` modes for processing guarantees.

- A. Correct.
- B. Helps producer reliability but not full EOS.
- C. Affects offset behavior, not guarantees.
- D. Controls batch size, not semantics.
```
