**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Interactive Queries allow applications or clients to query the local state stores directly for up-to-date data.

- A. Correct.
- B. Topology changes require redeployment.
- C. Not related.
- D. Monitoring is separate.
```

- A. KafkaStreams
- B. StreamsBuilder
- C. InteractiveQueryService
- D. StreamsMetadataState
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The KafkaStreams class exposes the Interactive Queries API such as `store()` methods to query local state.

## Question 3

```markdown
How do you specify the type of store you want to query interactively?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. By providing the store name and a QueryableStoreType instance
- B. By topic name only
- C. By stream name only
- D. By repartition topic name
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
You specify both the store name and a QueryableStoreType, like `QueryableStoreTypes.keyValueStore()`, to get the store instance.

- A. Correct.
- B. Topic name is not used here.
- C. Stream name is unrelated.
- D. Not relevant.
```

## Question 4

```markdown
What is a common use case for Interactive Queries?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Serving real-time data for REST endpoints from local state
- B. Writing data back to Kafka topics
- C. Rebalancing partitions
- D. Configuring consumer groups
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Interactive Queries are often used to serve local state directly for low-latency access in APIs.

- A. Correct.
- B. Writing data is separate.
- C. Partition rebalancing is managed by Kafka.
- D. Consumer groups unrelated.
```

</details>

## Question 5

```markdown
If the data you want to query is not available locally, what should your application do?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Query another instance that holds the data using Kafka Streams metadata
- B. Return empty results
- C. Throw an exception
- D. Repartition the data manually
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams provides metadata about which instance holds what partitions, allowing your app to query remote instances.

- A. Correct.
- B. Might lose data.
- C. Not ideal behavior.
- D. Repartitioning unrelated.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
Which method in KafkaStreams API returns metadata about which instance hosts a given key?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `KafkaStreams.metadataForKey(storeName, key, keySerde)`
- B. `KafkaStreams.getStore(storeName)`
- C. `KafkaStreams.getMetadataForAllStreamsClients()`
- D. `KafkaStreams.queryMetadata()`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`metadataForKey` returns metadata about which instance is responsible for a given key.

- A. Correct.
- B. Gets the store instance.
- C. Returns metadata for all clients.
- D. No such method.
```

</details>

## Question 7

```markdown
Interactive Queries support querying which types of state stores?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. KeyValueStore only
- B. WindowStore only
- C. Both KeyValueStore and WindowStore
- D. Only GlobalKTables
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Interactive Queries support querying multiple store types like KeyValueStore and WindowStore.

- A. Partially correct.
- B. Partially correct.
- C. Correct.
- D. GlobalKTables are accessible but not exclusive.
```

</details>

## Question 8

```markdown
What is one limitation of Interactive Queries?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Queries only access local state, requiring manual routing to other instances
- B. They can only be used for windowed stores
- C. They automatically update topology during queries
- D. They require repartition topics to function
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Interactive Queries only query local stores, so the application must handle locating remote stores.

- A. Correct.
- B. Incorrect.
- C. Topology is static.
- D. Not required.
```

</details>

## Question 9

```markdown
Which Kafka Streams configuration property is important to ensure the Interactive Queries metadata is accurate?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `application.server`
- B. `bootstrap.servers`
- C. `cache.max.bytes.buffering`
- D. `commit.interval.ms`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`application.server` config specifies the host:port for each instance, enabling discovery of instances and their metadata.

- A. Correct.
- B. Kafka broker connection.
- C. Caching config.
