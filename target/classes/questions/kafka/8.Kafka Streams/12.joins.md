For a KStream-KTable join to work correctly, both topics must have the same partition count and key distribution.

- A. Correct.
- B. Incorrect.
- C. Wrong, partition count matters.
- D. Incorrect.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
In a KStream-KStream join, what role does the join window play?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It defines the time range for matching records from each stream
- B. It controls repartition frequency
- C. It sets retention for output topics
- D. It is used for batching output records
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The join window defines the maximum time difference between records to be joined.

- A. Correct.
- B. No relation.
- C. Output topic retention is separate.
- D. No batching role.
```

- C. KTable-KTable join
- D. KStream-GlobalKTable join
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

## Question 9

```markdown
What is the difference between inner join and left join in Kafka Streams?

## Question 10

- C. Updates are batched before join
- D. The join output is delayed until the window closes
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Each update on either side can trigger a join and produce an updated output.

- A. Correct.
- B. No, joins are dynamic.
- C. No batching by default.
- D. Window delay applies only to windowed joins.
```

</details>



## Question 11

```markdown
You are deploying a Kafka Streams application that joins two high-volume streams. Which of the following is LEAST likely to improve the performance of the application?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Ensuring that the two input streams have the same number of partitions
- B. Increasing the number of standby replicas for the state store
- C. Tuning the `cache.max.bytes.buffering` parameter
- D. Increasing the `num.streams.threads` parameter
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Increasing the number of standby replicas for the state store in a Kafka Streams application can provide better fault tolerance by allowing faster failover to a replica if a node fails. However, it is unlikely to improve the normal operating performance of the application.

In contrast:

- A can improve performance by allowing the join to be performed more efficiently, with each partition able to be processed independently.
- C can improve performance by allowing more data to be buffered in memory before being flushed to the state store, reducing I/O overhead.
- D can improve performance by allowing more partitions to be processed concurrently, up to the number of partitions of the input topics.

```

## Question 12

```markdown
Select the Kafka Streams joins that are always windowed joins.
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. KStream – KStream
- B. KStream – KTable
- C. KTable – KTable
- D. GlobalKTable – KStream
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams defines certain join types as windowed by nature.

- A. KStream–KStream – Always windowed to prevent unbounded joins.
- B. KStream–KTable – Not windowed; joins are done based on latest value in the table.
- C. KTable–KTable – Not windowed; results in a new KTable.
- D. GlobalKTable–KStream – Not windowed; uses local lookups.
```
