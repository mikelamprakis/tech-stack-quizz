## Question 4

```markdown
An ecommerce website maintains two topics â€“ a high volume "purchase" topic with 5 partitions and a low volume "customer" topic with 3 partitions. You want to do a stream-table join. What is the best approach?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Do a KStream/KTable join after repartition
- B. Repartition the customer topic to have 5 partitions
- C. Model customer as a GlobalKTable
- D. Repartition the purchase topic to have 3 partitions
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
A GlobalKTable is fully replicated across all instances, making joins independent of partition count.

- A. KStream/KTable join requires matching partition counts; repartitioning is expensive.
- B. Repartitioning to 5 may solve the join issue but adds complexity.
- C. GlobalKTable avoids partition constraints and is efficient for lookups.
- D. Repartitioning the high-volume topic is costly and inefficient.
```

### Question 1

```markdown
What is a GlobalKTable in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. A partitioned table with data distributed across instances
- B. A fully replicated table available on all instances
- C. A streaming topic with windowed data
- D. A topic used for repartitioning streams
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Describes a regular KTable, which is partitioned.
- B. Correct. GlobalKTable replicates all data to all instances.
- C. Incorrect, this describes a KStream.
- D. Not related to GlobalKTable.
```

</details>

### Question 2

```markdown
How does a GlobalKTable differ from a KTable regarding data distribution?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. GlobalKTable data is partitioned; KTable data is fully replicated
- B. GlobalKTable data is fully replicated; KTable data is partitioned
- C. Both are fully replicated
- D. Both are partitioned similarly
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. This is the opposite.
- B. Correct. GlobalKTable replicates entire data to all instances.
- C. Incorrect.
- D. Incorrect.
```

</details>

### Question 3

```markdown
When is using a GlobalKTable preferable over a KTable?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. When you want to join a high-volume stream with low-volume reference data
- B. When you want to repartition large datasets
- C. When the table data is too large to replicate
- D. When windowing join operations are needed
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
GlobalKTable is good for low-volume reference data that needs to be available locally for efficient lookups.

- A. Correct.
- B. Repartitioning is unrelated.
- C. Large tables may be problematic for replication.
- D. GlobalKTables are not for windowed joins.
```

### Question 4

```markdown
How does Kafka Streams consume a GlobalKTable internally?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. As a changelog compacted topic consumed by all instances
- B. Through repartition topics
- C. As a normal topic with no compaction
- D. Using windowed state stores
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
GlobalKTable is built from a changelog compacted topic fully consumed by all instances.

- A. Correct.
- B. No repartition topics involved.
- C. Compaction is necessary.
- D. No windowing used.
```

</details>

### Question 5

```markdown
What is the impact on resource usage when using GlobalKTables?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Lower memory usage because data is partitioned
- B. Higher memory and network usage due to full replication
- C. No impact on resource usage
- D. Lower CPU usage because of windowing
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
GlobalKTables replicate all data to every instance, increasing memory and network load.

- A. Incorrect; partitioning reduces load, but GlobalKTable replicates fully.
- B. Correct.
- C. Incorrect.
- D. Windowing is unrelated.
```

</details>

### Question 6

```markdown
Can you perform a join between a KStream and a GlobalKTable?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Yes, this is a common join pattern
- B. No, joins are not supported
- C. Only if the GlobalKTable has the same partition count as the KStream
- D. Only for windowed joins
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Joining a KStream with a GlobalKTable is common, where the GlobalKTable provides local lookup data.

- A. Correct.
- B. Incorrect.
- C. Partition counts do not need to match.
- D. GlobalKTable joins are not windowed.
```

</details>

---

### Question 7

```markdown
What happens if a GlobalKTable is too large to fit into memory on each instance?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Kafka Streams will spill to disk automatically
- B. The application might face memory pressure and degrade performance
- C. The GlobalKTable will repartition automatically
- D. No impact; it streams data on demand
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
GlobalKTables fully replicate data in memory on all instances; if too large, it may cause performance problems.

- A. No automatic spill to disk.
- B. Correct.
- C. GlobalKTable does not repartition.
- D. Data is stored locally, not streamed on demand.
```

</details>

### Question 8

```markdown
How is fault tolerance handled for GlobalKTables in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. GlobalKTable is fault tolerant because data is replicated to all instances
- B. GlobalKTable has no fault tolerance
- C. Fault tolerance is provided by repartition topics
- D. Through windowed state stores
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Because GlobalKTables replicate full data to all instances, if one instance fails, others can continue with complete data.

- A. Correct.
- B. Incorrect.
- C. Repartition topics unrelated.
- D. Windowing unrelated.
```

</details>

### Question 9

```markdown
Can a GlobalKTable be used as a source in a Kafka Streams topology?

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Yes, GlobalKTables consume data from a source topic
- B. No, they are only used for joins
- C. Only if explicitly configured as source
- D. No, they require repartitioning first
```
