## Question 11

```markdown
Which of the following stream processing operations can be considered stateful? (Select all that apply)
```
**Options**

```markdown
- A. Filter: Discarding messages based on a condition
- B. Map: Transforming messages from one format to another
- C. Aggregate: Combining multiple messages into a single result
- D. Join: Combining messages from two different streams based on a common key
- E. Peek: Performing an action on each message without modifying it
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C,D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In stream processing, stateful operations are those that maintain and update a state based on the processed messages. They require the stream processor to keep track of some information over time.

1. Aggregate: Aggregation operations, such as counting, summing, or averaging values, are stateful because they need to maintain a running state of the aggregated result. The state is updated as new messages arrive, and the final result depends on the accumulated state over time.

2. Join: Join operations, especially window-based joins, are stateful because they need to maintain a state of the messages from both streams within a specified time window. The stream processor must store the messages temporarily to match and combine them based on a common key.

The other operations mentioned are generally considered stateless:

- Filter: Filtering messages based on a condition does not require maintaining any state. Each message is evaluated independently against the condition, and the decision to keep or discard the message is made solely based on the current message.

- Map: Transforming messages from one format to another is typically a stateless operation. Each message is processed independently, and the transformation logic is applied to each message without relying on any previous state.

- Peek: Performing an action on each message without modifying it, such as logging or publishing metrics, is usually stateless. The action is performed on each message independently, without maintaining any state across messages.

It's important to note that the specific implementation and requirements of a stream processing application can introduce statefulness to operations that are typically considered stateless. However, in general, aggregation and join operations are inherently stateful, while filtering, mapping, and peeking are often stateless.

## Question 12

```markdown
When using Kafka Streams DSL, how can you perform a stateful operation on a KStream?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. By using the `map` operation to modify the stream's values
- B. By using the `filter` operation to remove unwanted records from the stream
- C. By using the `groupByKey` operation to group the stream's records by key
- D. By using the `mapValues` operation to transform the stream's values
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
To perform a stateful operation on a KStream using Kafka Streams DSL, you use `groupByKey` to group records by their keys and obtain a KGroupedStream.

This grouped stream can then be used with stateful operations like `count`, `reduce`, or `aggregate` which maintain and update the state per key.

- A. `map` is stateless and simply transforms key-value pairs.
- B. `filter` removes records based on conditions, without maintaining any state.
- C. `groupByKey` enables stateful processing by grouping records for aggregation.
- D. `mapValues` transforms values but does not support stateful computation.
```
