## Question 1

```markdown
Why are windows necessary in Kafka Streams aggregations?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To repartition streams
- B. To bound unbounded data in time
- C. To allow for compression
- D. To ensure fault tolerance
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams is designed for infinite streams. Windows break the stream into time-bound chunks.

- A. Repartitioning is unrelated.
- B. Correct.
- C. Not the purpose of windows.
- D. Fault tolerance is handled elsewhere (e.g., changelogs).
```

## Question 2

```markdown
Which type of window emits intermediate results as new records arrive?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Hopping Window
- B. Tumbling Window
- C. Session Window
- D. None
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Hopping windows overlap, so a record may appear in multiple windows and update them as it arrives.

- A. Correct.
- B. Tumbling windows are non-overlapping.
- C. Session windows depend on gaps between records.
- D. Not true.
```

</details>

## Question 3

```markdown
What defines a tumbling window in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Fixed size, non-overlapping
- B. Fixed size, overlapping
- C. Variable size, overlapping
- D. Session-based, user-triggered
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Tumbling windows are time windows with a fixed size that do not overlap.

- A. Correct.
- B. That’s hopping windows.
- C. Not true.
- D. Session windows depend on inactivity gap, not user trigger.
```

</details>

## Question 4

```markdown
Which window type is best for detecting bursts of user activity?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Tumbling Window
- B. Session Window
- C. Hopping Window
- D. Join Window
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Session windows group events separated by a user-defined inactivity gap.

- A. Fixed size, not burst-based.
- B. Correct.
- C. Overlapping but not behavior-driven.
- D. Not a window type.
```

</details>

## Question 5

```markdown
What happens when two records arrive within the session inactivity gap?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. They are placed in separate sessions
- B. The previous session is closed
- C. They are merged into one session
- D. One is discarded
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Records within the gap duration belong to the same session and merge accordingly.

- A. Only if the gap is exceeded.
- B. Session closes on inactivity.
- C. Correct.
- D. Kafka Streams does not discard unless configured.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
Which windowing function do you use to join KStreams within a time bound?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. TimeWindows.of(...)
- B. SessionWindows.with(...)
- C. JoinWindows.of(...)
- D. HoppingWindows.of(...)
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`JoinWindows` are used specifically for KStream-KStream joins.

- A. For aggregations, not joins.
- B. For session-based aggregations.
- C. Correct.
- D. Only for aggregation.
```

</details>

## Question 7

```markdown
What does the “grace period” in windowing control?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Time to wait for delayed records
- B. Maximum session duration
- C. Offset commit interval
- D. Output topic retention
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The grace period allows late-arriving records to still be included in a window.

- A. Correct.
- B. That’s session inactivity gap.
- C. Not related.
- D. Topic configs are unrelated to window grace.
```

</details>

## Question 8

```markdown
Which of the following operations **requires** a window definition?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. mapValues()
- B. join(KStream, ...)
- C. count()
- D. join(KTable, ...)
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
KStream–KStream joins need to be bounded by time via a window.

- A. Stateless.
- B. Correct – joins need windowing to avoid unbounded results.
- C. Can be windowed or non-windowed.
- D. No window needed.
```

</details>

## Question 9

```markdown
You’re counting login events per user per minute. Which window type should you use?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Tumbling
- B. Session
- C. Hopping
- D. GlobalKTable
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Tumbling windows work great for fixed-interval aggregation like per-minute counts.

- A. Correct.
- B. Depends on user inactivity.
- C. Would overlap minutes.
- D. Not a windowing construct.
```

</details>

## Question 10

```markdown
If you use a hopping window of size 5 minutes and advance of 1 minute, how many windows will a single record appear in?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1
- B. 5
- C. 0
- D. Depends on timestamp
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
It depends on the record's timestamp and how many 5-min windows it falls into due to the 1-min hop.

- A. Only true for tumbling.
- B. Possible if it fits all.
- C. Never zero.
- D. Correct – depends on where it lands.
```
