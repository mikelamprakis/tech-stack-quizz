## Question 21

```markdown
How can the `client.id` setting be useful in monitoring and troubleshooting Kafka clients?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It allows setting different configuration parameters for each client
- B. It enables tracking and correlating client activity in logs and metrics
- C. It determines the partitioning strategy used by the client
- D. It specifies the maximum number of connections the client can establish
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `client.id` setting is used to track and correlate Kafka client activity in logs and metrics. By assigning a unique `client.id` to each client, you can easily trace their behavior in Kafka broker logs and monitoring systems. This is especially useful for debugging issues, analyzing performance, and understanding the workload patterns of individual clients.

- A. Incorrect – `client.id` does not configure other parameters.
- B. Correct – it provides traceability in logs and metrics.
- C. Incorrect – partitioning is handled by the producer configuration, not `client.id`.
- D. Incorrect – this is unrelated to connection limits.
