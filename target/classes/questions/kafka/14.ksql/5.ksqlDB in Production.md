## Question 17

```markdown
What are the differences between persistent and non-persistent queries in KSQL Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Persistent queries continuously read from and write to Kafka topics.
- B. Stateless non-persistent queries only read data and do not write to Kafka topics.
- C. Non-persistent queries continually write to Kafka topics.
- D. Stateful non-persistent queries read and temporarily write to Kafka, but this data is deleted when the query is terminated.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A, B, D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In Kafka, persistent queries, such as those created using CREATE STREAM AS SELECT and CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, continuously read from and write to Kafka topics. Non-persistent queries, on the other hand, do not continually write to Kafka topics. Stateless non-persistent queries, like simple SELECT ... FROM foo WHERE ..., only read data. Stateful non-persistent queries, which include operations like COUNT and JOIN, read and temporarily write to Kafka, but this data is deleted when the query is terminated.
```
