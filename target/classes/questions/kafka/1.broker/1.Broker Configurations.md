## Question 2

```markdown
You are tasked with configuring a Kafka broker to manage how long data is retained before it is deleted to ensure efficient storage management. How do you adjust log retention settings in Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Set the storage.duration limits in the consumer.properties file.

- B. Reduce the number of topics
- C. Set quotas for byte-rate and request-rate limits
- D. Increase the number of partitions
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

## Question 4

```markdown
If a Kafka administrator needs to adjust broker configurations to handle increased load without downtime, which feature should they use?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Load balancing reassignment
- B. Static broker reconfiguration
- C. Dynamic broker configuration
- D. Broker performance tuning
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka's dynamic broker configuration allows administrators to modify certain settings at runtime without restarting brokers, thus avoiding downtime and adapting to changing conditions.
```

</details>

---

## Question 5

```markdown
You are administering a Kafka cluster and need to update a configuration setting that is classified as read-only. What must you do to apply this change, and why is this necessary?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Use the Kafka command-line tool to apply the configuration change immediately
- B. Update the configuration setting in the broker configuration file and restart the broker
- C. Change the configuration setting in ZooKeeper and restart the broker
- D. Update the configuration setting dynamically using the Kafka configuration API
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In Kafka, read-only configurations are settings that cannot be dynamically updated while the broker is running. To change these configurations, you must update the setting in the broker configuration file and restart the broker. This ensures that changes are fully integrated and effective across the Kafka system, maintaining stability and consistency in broker operations.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
What configuration setting in Kafka determines where logs (data) are stored?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. kafka.storage
- B. data.paths
- C. file.locations
- D. log.dirs
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The log.dirs setting in server.properties specifies the directories where Kafka's logs and data are stored.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
How do broker-level settings differ from topic-level settings in Kafka, and when might you use each?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Topic-level settings are only applicable to consumer configurations.
- B. Broker-level settings deal with network configurations, while topic-level settings handle data processing.
- C. Broker-level settings are immutable, while topic-level settings can be changed dynamically.
- D. Broker-level settings apply cluster-wide, whereas topic-level settings allow customization for individual topics.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Broker-level settings provide cluster-wide defaults that affect all topics unless overridden, while topic-level settings offer granularity, allowing administrators to tailor settings such as retention policies and partition counts based on specific topic requirements.
```
