## Question 5

```markdown
Why might a high-throughput Kafka producer experience high memory usage?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Because it uses `acks=0`
- B. Because of too many in-flight requests and batching
- C. Because it writes directly to all partitions
- D. Because compression increases memory usage
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Larger batches, more in-flight requests, and async retries all consume memory.

- A. False – `acks` level doesn’t directly affect memory.

```

</details>

## Question 14

```markdown
What is the relationship between `batch.size` and `linger.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. They are mutually exclusive settings
- B. `linger.ms` is only relevant if `batch.size` is set to 0
- C. `batch.size` is only relevant if `linger.ms` is set to 0
- D. They work together to control when a batch is considered ready to send
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In the Kafka producer, `batch.size` and `linger.ms` work together to determine when a batch of messages is sent:

- `batch.size` defines the maximum amount of data to collect before sending a batch.
- `linger.ms` defines how long to wait for more messages before sending the current batch.

A batch is sent when **either** the `batch.size` is reached **or** the `linger.ms` time elapses, whichever comes first.
This cooperation helps balance latency and throughput.
```

## Question 15

```markdown
What is the effect of increasing `batch.size` in a Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It increases the maximum size of each individual message
- B. It increases the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single request
- C. It increases the maximum time a batch will wait before being sent
- D. It increases the maximum amount of memory the producer will use for buffering
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Increasing `batch.size` allows the Kafka producer to collect more messages before sending them in a single request, improving throughput. It refers to the **maximum bytes per batch**, not the number of messages directly, but more messages usually means more bytes.

- A is wrong — individual message size is managed by `max.request.size`.
- C is wrong — batching delay is controlled by `linger.ms`.
- D is misleading — `batch.size` is per partition, but total memory usage is controlled by `buffer.memory`.
```

</details>

---

## Question 16

```markdown
What happens if `linger.ms` is set to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will never send any messages
- B. The producer will wait indefinitely for each batch to fill up before sending
- C. The producer will send each message as soon as it is received, without batching
- D. The producer will use the default linger time
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Setting `linger.ms = 0` means the producer **won’t wait at all** — messages are sent as soon as possible.
This reduces latency but disables batching benefits, lowering throughput.

- A is false — messages are still sent.
- B is the opposite of what happens — no waiting occurs.
- D is wrong — 0 is a valid override, not a fallback to default.
```

</details>

---

## Question 17

```markdown
What is the purpose of the `linger.ms` setting in the Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To specify the maximum time to wait for a response from the Kafka broker
- B. To specify the maximum time to wait before sending a batch of messages
- C. To specify the maximum time to wait for a message to be acknowledged by the Kafka broker
- D. To specify the maximum time to wait for a message to be written to the Kafka topic
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`linger.ms` introduces a delay to allow more messages to accumulate before a batch is sent, helping improve throughput.

- A. Wrong – that’s more related to request timeout.
- B. Correct – controls batching delay.
- C. Wrong – refers to `request.timeout.ms`.
- D. Wrong – message writing is internal to Kafka.
```

</details>

## Question 18

```markdown
How does the `batch.size` setting affect the behavior of the Kafka producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It specifies the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single batch
- B. It specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of a batch of messages
- C. It specifies the minimum number of messages required to form a batch
- D. It specifies the minimum size (in bytes) of a message to be included in a batch
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`batch.size` is the upper limit in bytes for messages in one batch. It's about size, not count.

- A. Incorrect – it’s about size, not message count.
- B. Correct – defines byte limit.
- C. Wrong – no minimum count constraint.
- D. Wrong – batch applies to batches, not individual messages.
```

</details>

## Question 19

```markdown
How can you configure a Kafka producer for low latency message delivery?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Reduce linger.ms to 0 and use a smaller batch.size.
- B. Increase linger.ms to the maximum possible value.
- C. Set batch.size to its maximum to ensure large batch processing.
- D. Disable all acknowledgements with acks set to '0'.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
For low latency message delivery, minimizing linger.ms helps send messages immediately without waiting to batch, and a smaller batch.size ensures that messages are sent as soon as they are available, both reducing delivery delay.
```
