## Question 1

```markdown
What is the effect of setting `acks=0` in a Kafka producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will wait for the broker to acknowledge the message before sending the next one
- B. The producer will wait for the leader and all replicas to acknowledge the message
- C. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker
- D. The producer will throw an exception if the broker does not acknowledge the message
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
With `acks=0`, the producer sends data and does not wait for any acknowledgement. It offers the highest throughput but no delivery guarantees.

- A. Describes `acks=1` or `acks=all`
- B. Describes `acks=all`
- C. Correct — no acknowledgements are expected
- D. Incorrect — producer does not throw errors when acks=0
```

## Question 2

```markdown
What is the relationship between `request.timeout.ms` and `delivery.timeout.ms` in a Kafka producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `request.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `delivery.timeout.ms`
- B. `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. They should always be set to the same value
- D. They are independent and can be set to any value
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`delivery.timeout.ms` is the total time allowed to deliver a message including all retries. `request.timeout.ms` is per-request. If delivery timeout is less than request timeout, a send may time out before the request does, which is not ideal.

- A. Opposite — would cause premature timeouts.
- B. Correct — ensures retries work within delivery window.
- C. Not necessary, and may cause unintentional issues.
- D. Technically true, but not recommended without understanding the interplay.
```

## Question 3

```markdown
A Kafka producer application needs to send messages to a topic. The messages do not require any particular order. Which of the following properties are mandatory in the producer configuration? (Select two)
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. compression.type
- B. partitioner.class
- C. bootstrap.servers
- D. key.serializer
- E. value.serializer
- F. client.id
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C, E

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`bootstrap.servers` is required to connect to Kafka brokers, and `value.serializer` is needed to serialize the message values. All others are optional or have defaults.

- A. Optional performance setting
- B. Optional for custom partitioning
- C. Required — without it, producer can't connect
- D. Only needed if you use keys
- E. Required — must serialize value
- F. Optional identifier for logs/metrics
```

## Question 4

```markdown
What is the effect of setting `acks=0` in a Kafka producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will wait for the broker to acknowledge the message before sending the next one
- B. The producer will wait for the leader and all replicas to acknowledge the message
- C. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker
- D. The producer will throw an exception if the broker does not acknowledge the message
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`acks=0` means fire-and-forget. No confirmation is expected, maximizing throughput but sacrificing reliability.

- A. Incorrect: That’s `acks=1` or `acks=all`.
- B. Incorrect: That’s `acks=all`.
- C. Correct: It doesn’t wait for any acknowledgment.
- D. Incorrect: No exception is thrown since no ack is expected.
```

</details>

## Question 5

```markdown
What is the relationship between `request.timeout.ms` and `delivery.timeout.ms` in a Kafka producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `request.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `delivery.timeout.ms`
- B. `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. They should always be set to the same value
- D. They are independent and can be set to any value
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`request.timeout.ms` governs how long to wait for one request, while `delivery.timeout.ms` is the total retry budget. The latter must be greater.

- A. Incorrect: The opposite is recommended.
- B. Correct: `delivery.timeout.ms` includes potential retries.
- C. Incorrect: It could cause premature failures.
- D. Technically true, but not advised in practice.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
A Kafka producer application needs to send messages to a topic. The messages do not require any particular order. Which of the following properties are mandatory in the producer configuration? (Select two)
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `compression.type`
- B. `partitioner.class`
- C. `bootstrap.servers`
- D. `key.serializer`
- E. `value.serializer`
- F. `client.id`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C, E

**Explanation:**

```markdown
To connect and serialize messages, `bootstrap.servers` and `value.serializer` are required.

- A. Optional: Enhances efficiency, not required.
- B. Optional: Default partitioner is used otherwise.
- C. Required: Without this, no broker connection.
- D. Optional: Only needed if you're sending keys.
- E. Required: Values must be serialized.
- F. Optional: Useful for logging/monitoring, not mandatory.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
What is the purpose of setting `compression.type` in a Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To specify the compression algorithm used when sending data to Kafka
- B. To specify the compression algorithm used when storing data on Kafka brokers
- C. To enable or disable compression for the producer
- D. To set the compression level for the producer
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The producer compresses records before transmission using the specified algorithm (e.g. `gzip`, `lz4`, `zstd`, etc.).

- A. Correct: It's about producer-to-broker compression.
- B. Misleading: Brokers store whatever is received.
- C. False: Compression is not simply on/off; it's about type.
- D. False: Kafka doesn’t let you tune compression level.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
What is the relationship between `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. They are redundant settings that control the same thing
- B. `linger.ms` should always be set higher than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. `request.timeout.ms` should always be set higher than `linger.ms`
- D. They control independent aspects of the producer behavior
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`linger.ms` is how long the producer waits to fill a batch before sending.
`request.timeout.ms` is how long the producer waits for a broker acknowledgment.

To avoid premature timeouts, `request.timeout.ms` should **always** be set **higher** than `linger.ms`.

- A is incorrect — they control distinct stages (before send vs after send).
- B is backwards — the opposite is true.
- D is partially true, but misses the coordination requirement.
```

## Question 9

```markdown
You want to produce messages to a Kafka topic using a Java client. Which of the following is NOT a required configuration for the producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. bootstrap.servers
- B. key.serializer
- C. value.serializer
- D. partitioner.class
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka producers require `bootstrap.servers`, `key.serializer`, and `value.serializer`.
- A, B, and C are essential.
- D is optional – Kafka uses a default partitioner unless a custom one is specified.
```

</details>

## Question 10

```markdown
What is the relationship between the `acks` parameter and the `request.required.acks` parameter in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. They are the same parameter, just with different names
- B. `acks` is used in the producer configuration, while `request.required.acks` is used in the consumer configuration
- C. `acks` is used in the new producer API, while `request.required.acks` is used in the old producer API
- D. They are completely unrelated parameters
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`acks` and `request.required.acks` serve the same purpose:

- A. Not quite – naming reflects API version.
- B. False – both are producer configs.
- C. True – `acks` is for the new producer API; `request.required.acks` was used in the legacy one.
- D. False – they are related.
```

</details>

## Question 11

```markdown
What happens if the Kafka producer exhausts its buffer memory while sending messages?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will block and wait until buffer memory becomes available
- B. The producer will start discarding the oldest messages to free up buffer memory
- C. The producer will start discarding the newest messages to free up buffer memory
- D. The producer will throw an exception and stop sending messages
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
If buffer memory fills up, the producer blocks until space is available or `max.block.ms` is exceeded.

- A. Correct – default behavior is blocking.
- B. Incorrect – Kafka doesn’t evict messages from buffer.
- C. Incorrect – no discarding of newest messages.
- D. Partially true, but only after blocking timeout.
```

</details>

## Question 12

```markdown
How does the `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` setting affect the behavior of the Kafka producer when `acks=1`?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged requests allowed per broker connection
- B. It specifies the maximum number of requests that can be sent to the broker concurrently
- C. It specifies the maximum number of messages that can be buffered in the producer's memory
- D. It has no effect when `acks=1`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
This config limits the number of unacknowledged requests per connection, which can affect ordering if retries happen.

- A. Correct – defines number of unacknowledged sends.
- B. Close, but wording is vague – not about concurrency alone.
- C. Incorrect – that’s `buffer.memory`.
- D. Incorrect – setting still matters with `acks=1`.
```

</details>

## Question 13

```markdown
What is the purpose of the `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster
- B. To set the maximum number of requests the client can send or receive
- C. To determine the compression type used for message production or consumption
- D. To control the maximum amount of memory the client can use for buffering
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `client.id` helps uniquely identify clients in logs and metrics. It is useful for monitoring and debugging but has no impact on message delivery, memory usage, or compression.

- A. Correct – `client.id` is used for tracking/logging.
- B. Incorrect – not related to throughput or rate limits.
- C. Incorrect – compression is configured separately.
- D. Incorrect – buffering is controlled by other configs.
```

</details>

---

## Question 14

```markdown
What happens if multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The clients will share the same configuration and connection pooling
- B. The clients will be treated as a single logical client by the Kafka brokers
- C. The behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors
- D. The Kafka brokers will reject the connection attempts from clients with duplicate `client.id`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Using the same `client.id` across multiple clients can cause confusion in monitoring and metrics. Kafka does not enforce uniqueness, and while it won’t reject connections, it may lead to misattributed logs or unpredictable behavior.

- A. Incorrect – no configuration or connection sharing happens.
- B. Incorrect – brokers track connections independently.
- C. Correct – duplicate IDs confuse monitoring/logs.
- D. Incorrect – Kafka allows duplicate IDs.
```

## Question 15

```markdown
What is returned by a `producer.send()` call in the Java API?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. A boolean
- B. Unit
- C. Future
- D. Future object
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`producer.send()` returns a `Future<RecordMetadata>` which can be used to track send completion or exceptions.

- A. Not a boolean.
- B. Not unit (void).
- C. Inexact — should specify Future type.
- D. Correct — returns a Future object.
```

</details>

## Question 16

```markdown
Imagine you are configuring a Kafka producer for an application that experiences high data generation rates during peak hours. How should you configure the max.block.ms and buffer.memory settings to ensure smooth operation during these periods?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Set max.block.ms to a higher value
- B. Reduce max.block.ms
- C. Increase buffer.memory
- D. Decrease buffer.memory
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A, C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
During periods of high data generation, increasing buffer.memory allows the producer to hold more data temporarily when the broker's acceptance rate cannot keep up, reducing the risk of overrunning the buffer. Additionally, configuring a longer max.block.ms helps the producer handle data bursts more gracefully by extending the time it will wait before timing out, thus reducing the chances of data loss and application errors due to blocked sends.
```

</details>

---

## Question 17

```markdown
What does the request.timeout.ms setting control in Kafka producers?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. The expiration time of a message in the queue.
- B. The interval at which requests are retried.
- C. The time Kafka stores unacknowledged messages.
- D. The duration Kafka will wait for a broker response to a request.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The request.timeout.ms setting determines how long the producer waits for a response from the broker after sending data. This helps manage the behavior during network issues or broker failures.
```
