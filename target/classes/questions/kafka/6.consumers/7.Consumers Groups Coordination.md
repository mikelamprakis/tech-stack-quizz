## Question 1

```markdown
In a consumer group with 5 members and a topic with 3 partitions, how many consumers will be actively processing messages during normal operation?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. 1
- B. 3
- C. 5
- D. 2
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

## Question 2

```markdown
During a rebalance, what happens if the elected group leader fails before completing the assignment?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. The group remains in rebalance state indefinitely
- B. A new leader is elected and the process restarts
- C. The coordinator assigns partitions randomly
- D. Consumers revert to their previous assignments
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The group coordinator detects leader failure and initiates a new leader election to complete the rebalance.

## Question 3

```markdown
What occurs when two consumer groups with the same group.id subscribe to different topics?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. The second group fails to initialize
- B. Both groups merge into a single coordinated group
- C. They operate independently with separate offsets
- D. Kafka throws a duplicate group exception
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

## Question 4

```markdown
A consumer group using RangeAssignor has 3 members (C1-C3) and a topic with partitions p0-p5. Which statement about the assignment is true?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Partitions are assigned in strict numerical order
- B. Some consumers may get more partitions than others
- C. Assignment follows a perfect round-robin distribution
- D. Partition counts per consumer differ by at most 1
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
RangeAssignor can create uneven assignments (e.g., C1:p0-p1, C2:p2-p3, C3:p4-p5) leading to imbalance.

- A. Incorrect: Numerical but not necessarily balanced
- B. Correct: Range can cause uneven distribution
- C. Incorrect: That's RoundRobin behavior
- D. Incorrect: StickyAssignor has this property
```

```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 50% of the group
- D. All members must agree
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
With static membership, even a single consumer joining/leaving can trigger rebalance, though the impact may be minimized.

- A. Correct: Any membership change can trigger
- B. Incorrect: No minimum participant requirement
- C. Incorrect: No quorum-based triggering
- D. Incorrect: Not a consensus process
```

## Question 6

```markdown
When does the group coordinator initiate a rebalance for a consumer that hasn't sent heartbeats?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Immediately after first missed heartbeat
- B. After `session.timeout.ms` expires
- C. When `max.poll.interval.ms` is exceeded
- D. After 3 consecutive heartbeat failures
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The coordinator waits for the full session timeout before declaring a consumer dead and triggering rebalance.

- A. Incorrect: Allows for temporary network issues
- B. Correct: Session timeout governs liveness
- C. Incorrect: Poll timeout is separate from heartbeats
- D. Incorrect: No fixed retry count
```

## Question 7

```markdown
In a group with CooperativeStickyAssignor, what happens to a partition when its assigned consumer fails?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. It's reassigned while other partitions remain stable
- B. All partitions undergo complete reassignment
- C. The partition remains unassigned until recovery
- D. The coordinator takes temporary ownership
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Cooperative rebalancing only revokes and reassigns affected partitions, minimizing disruption.

- A. Correct: Minimal reassignment occurs
- B. Incorrect: That's traditional rebalancing
- C. Incorrect: Partitions don't stay unassigned
- D. Incorrect: Coordinators don't consume
```

## Question 8

```markdown
What occurs if a consumer joins a group but doesn't subscribe to any topics?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. It receives no partitions but remains in group
- B. The join fails with InvalidSubscriptionException
- C. It triggers continuous rebalance loops
- D. The coordinator assigns random partitions
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The consumer remains group member but receives no assignments until subscribing to topics.

- A. Correct: Valid but inactive membership
- B. Incorrect: No exception is thrown
- C. Incorrect: Doesn't cause instability
- D. Incorrect: No arbitrary assignments
```

</details>

## Question 9

```markdown
How does Kafka prevent two consumers with the same `group.instance.id` from joining simultaneously?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Session tokens invalidate duplicates
- B. The coordinator rejects conflicting registrations
- C. Zookeeper enforces unique ephemeral nodes
- D. Consumers detect and resolve conflicts peer-to-peer
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The group coordinator maintains member registry and rejects duplicate static IDs.

- A. Incorrect: No token mechanism exists
- B. Correct: Coordinator enforces uniqueness
- C. Incorrect: Modern Kafka doesn't use Zookeeper for this
- D. Incorrect: No peer conflict resolution
```

- B. They persist according to `offsets.retention.minutes`
- C. They transfer to the coordinator broker
- D. They are compacted into a single offset
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Offsets are retained for the configured retention period before being deleted.

- B. Correct: Retention policy governs cleanup
- C. Incorrect: Offsets stay in `__consumer_offsets`
- D. Incorrect: No compaction occurs
```

## Question 4

```markdown
What is the difference between assign and subscribe methods in Kafka consumers?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. subscribe is used for manual partition assignments, while assign is used for dynamic partition assignment.
- B. assign manually specified partitions, whereas subscribe automatically assigns partitions based on the topic.
- C. assign does not allow joining consumer groups, but subscribe does.
- D. Both methods perform the same function but subscribe is used more frequently in distributed systems.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The subscribe method allows consumers to dynamically receive partitions and join consumer groups, while assign manually specified partitions without consumer group coordination.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
How do consumers interact with the __consumer_offsets topic in Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Consumers read and write offsets directly to the __consumer_offsets topic.
- B. Consumers write their offsets directly to the __consumer_offsets topic.
- C. Consumers synchronize their offsets with each other without using the __consumer_offsets topic.
- D. Consumers interact with a broker elected as the Group Coordinator, which manages updates to the __consumer_offsets topic.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In Kafka, consumers do not write directly to the __consumer_offsets topic. Instead, they interact with a broker that has been elected as the Group Coordinator for their specific consumer group. This Group Coordinator broker manages all updates to the __consumer_offsets topic, such as tracking the offset each consumer has read to ensure message delivery and consumer progress. This setup centralizes consumer management and offsets tracking, enhancing efficiency and reliability.
