```markdown  
- A. Via ZooKeeper's ephemeral node expiration.  
- B. By monitoring broker heartbeats to the metadata log.  
- C. Through direct TCP health checks between brokers.  
- D. Using external monitoring tools like Prometheus.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

- C. The cluster becomes unavailable until a majority of controllers are restored
- D. The brokers take over the responsibilities of the controllers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

- A. Incorrect — system halts, not just slow
- B. Incorrect — quorum isn’t dynamically rebuilt
- C. Correct — requires majority to recover
- D. Incorrect — roles are not interchangeable
```

</details>

</details>

---

## Question 7

```markdown
What is the impact of setting the `controller.quorum.election.backoff.max.ms` configuration to a very high value in KRaft mode?

- D. It has no impact on the controller election process
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
A high value prolongs the wait time before brokers attempt election, increasing controller election time and downtime.

- A. Incorrect — Frequency is not increased, it's delayed.
- B. Incorrect — Time to election is increased, not reduced.
- C. Correct — Longer backoff increases election duration and downtime.
- D. Incorrect — The setting affects the election process directly.

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. Kafka never auto-deletes partitions.  
- B. `min.insync.replicas` is immutable.

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Setting `controller.quorum.fetch.timeout.ms` to a very low value reduces the waiting time for fetch responses.

- A is incorrect because the time decreases.

## Question 10

```markdown
Can Kafka's zero-copy optimization be used in combination with compression?

```

**Options**

```markdown

## Question 13

```markdown
In the context of Kafka's distributed architecture, broker elections are vital for cluster health and stability. Consider the following advanced scenarios where Kafka's internal mechanisms must decide on leadership roles:
