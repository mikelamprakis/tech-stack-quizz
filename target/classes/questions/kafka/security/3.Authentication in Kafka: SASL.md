Here are 15 challenging questions based on the "Authentication in Kafka: SASL" document, designed to simulate the real Kafka certification exam:

---

## Question 1

```markdown
What is the primary purpose of SASL in Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. To encrypt data in transit
- B. To authorize access to specific topics
- C. To authenticate client identity
- D. To compress message payloads
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
SASL is used to authenticate client identity, ensuring only verified clients can connect to Kafka. Encryption is handled by SSL/TLS, and authorization is managed by ACLs.

- A. Incorrect: Encryption is handled by SSL/TLS.
- B. Incorrect: Authorization is managed by ACLs.
- C. Correct: SASL verifies client identity.
- D. Incorrect: Compression is unrelated to SASL.
```

</details>

## Question 2

```markdown
Which SASL mechanism is recommended for production environments due to its salted password hashing?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. SASL/PLAIN
- B. SASL/SCRAM
- C. SASL/GSSAPI
- D. SASL/OAUTHBEARER
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
SASL/SCRAM uses salted password hashing, making it more secure than PLAIN. GSSAPI and OAUTHBEARER serve different use cases.

- A. Incorrect: PLAIN uses plaintext passwords and is insecure without SSL.
- B. Correct: SCRAM uses salted hashing for security.
- C. Incorrect: GSSAPI is for Kerberos integration.
- D. Incorrect: OAUTHBEARER is token-based.
```

- B. SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256
- C. SASL/MD5
- D. SASL/OAUTHBEARER
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
SASL/MD5 is not a supported mechanism in Kafka. Supported mechanisms include PLAIN, SCRAM, GSSAPI, and OAUTHBEARER.

- A. Incorrect: PLAIN is supported (simple username/password).
- B. Incorrect: SCRAM-SHA-256 is supported.
- C. Correct: MD5 is not a valid SASL mechanism in Kafka.

- C. SSL and SASL both authenticate clients.
- D. SSL and SASL both encrypt data.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
SSL encrypts data in transit, while SASL verifies client identity. They are often used together for security.

- A. Incorrect: SSL encrypts; SASL authenticates.
- B. Correct: SSL encrypts data; SASL authenticates clients.
- C. Incorrect: Only SASL authenticates clients.
- D. Incorrect: Only SSL encrypts data.

- D. A ZooKeeper connection string
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

- C. Inability to use ACLs
- D. Slower message throughput
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

- B. A ZooKeeper ensemble
- C. Disabled ACLs
- D. No SSL encryption
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

- B. ACLs are enforced before SASL authentication
- C. SASL authenticates clients, while ACLs authorize actions
- D. ACLs are only used with SASL/PLAIN
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
SASL handles authentication (verifying identity), while ACLs handle authorization (granting permissions). They are separate but complementary.

- A. Incorrect: SASL and ACLs serve different purposes.

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

## Question 16

```markdown
What is the purpose of the `sasl.kerberos.service.name` configuration in Kafka?
```

**Options**

- D. To define the service name used by Kafka brokers for SASL authentication
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

- B. To set the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication (e.g., PLAIN, SCRAM)
- C. To configure the SASL client and server callbacks for authentication
- D. To define the JAAS login configuration inline in Kafka configuration
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `sasl.jaas.config` property allows inlining the JAAS login configuration directly in Kafka configs, useful in containerized or automated environments.

- A. Incorrect – that's the role of `java.security.auth.login.config`.
- B. Incorrect – this is handled by the `sasl.mechanism` setting.
- C. Incorrect – callbacks are separate and not specified here.

- C. To set the path to the JAAS configuration file for SASL authentication
- D. To enable or disable SASL authentication in Kafka
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
