## Question 1

```markdown
What does Kafka's Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS) primarily guarantee?

```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. A message is stored only once on disk
- B. A consumer reads each message at most once
- C. A message is neither lost nor duplicated throughout the processing pipeline
- D. A message is written to external systems exactly once
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Disk storage is not the focus of EOS.
- B. EOS is not limited to consumer delivery guarantees alone.
- C. Correct — EOS ensures messages are processed once end-to-end without duplication or loss.
- D. EOS does not extend to external systems like databases or APIs.
```

## Question 2

```markdown
What is the role of idempotence in Kafka's producer to achieve EOS?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It ensures messages are encrypted exactly once
- B. It deduplicates messages on the consumer side
- C. It prevents duplicate message writes due to retries
- D. It avoids broker replication inconsistencies
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Idempotence is unrelated to encryption.
- B. Idempotence is applied on the producer side, not consumer.
- C. Correct — Idempotence allows the producer to retry without creating duplicates.
- D. Broker replication is not managed by idempotence.
```

## Question 3

```markdown
Which configuration must be enabled on the producer to activate idempotence?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. enable.idempotence=true
- B. acks=0
- C. transactional.id=producer-1
- D. retries=0
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Correct — this enables idempotent producer behavior.
- B. acks=0 disables delivery guarantees.
- C. transactional.id enables transactions, not just idempotence.
- D. retries=0 disables retrying and isn't related to enabling idempotence.
```

</details>

## Question 4

```markdown
Which of the following best defines Kafka's "at-most-once" delivery guarantee?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Messages are never lost
- B. Messages are processed one or more times
- C. Messages may be lost but never duplicated
- D. Messages are guaranteed to be delivered once
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. At-most-once allows for possible message loss.
- B. That describes at-least-once.
- C. Correct — it prioritizes no duplication, but loss is possible.
- D. That would describe exactly-once.
```

</details>

## Question 5

```markdown
Which combination guarantees exactly-once semantics in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. enable.idempotence=true + acks=0
- B. enable.idempotence=true + retries=0
- C. enable.idempotence=true + transactional.id set
- D. enable.idempotence=false + transactional.id set
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. acks=0 disables durability guarantees, breaking EOS.
- B. retries=0 disables retriable delivery, weakening reliability.
- C. Correct — both idempotence and transactions are required for EOS.
- D. Idempotence must be enabled alongside transactions.
```

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown
Which of the following is a **common misconception** about Kafka's exactly-once semantics?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. EOS requires idempotence and transactions
- B. EOS extends to external systems like databases
- C. EOS is supported in Kafka Streams
- D. EOS requires specific consumer configurations
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. That is true, not a misconception.
- B. Correct — EOS only applies within Kafka; external sinks are not included.
- C. Kafka Streams does support EOS.
- D. Consumers must use `read_committed`, which is correct.
```

</details>

---

## Question 7

```markdown
In Kafka, what does **"at-least-once"** delivery imply?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Every message will be delivered exactly one time
- B. Messages may be delivered multiple times but not lost
- C. Messages are never delivered unless acknowledged
- D. Messages may be lost but never duplicated
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. That’s EOS, not at-least-once.
- B. Correct — duplicates can occur due to retries, but no message is lost.
- C. This describes acknowledgment behavior, not delivery semantics.
- D. That describes at-most-once.
```

</details>

## Question 8

```markdown
Which of the following *best* describes the difference between idempotence and transactions?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Idempotence spans multiple partitions; transactions do not
- B. Transactions ensure duplicates are retried; idempotence prevents retries
- C. Idempotence avoids duplicate writes; transactions group writes atomically
- D. Idempotence requires changelogs; transactions do not
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Transactions can span partitions; idempotence does not.
- B. This is incorrect — both support retries differently.
- C. Correct — idempotence prevents duplicates, while transactions ensure atomic multi-topic writes.
- D. Changelogs are used in Kafka Streams, not core EOS.
```

## Question 9

```markdown
What is a key reason why EOS cannot be fully guaranteed when integrating with external systems?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Kafka doesn’t support external system writes
- B. External systems don’t have Kafka-compatible offset tracking
- C. Kafka can't read from external systems
- D. External systems always reject transactional writes
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Kafka integrations do exist (e.g., Kafka Connect).
- B. Correct — without exactly-once offset and state coordination, EOS breaks.
- C. Reading is not related to EOS guarantees.
- D. Not all external systems reject transactions — it’s about coordination.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
Which of the following is NOT a required component for end-to-end EOS?

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Idempotent producer
- B. Transactional writes
- C. read_committed consumer setting
- D. Compact topic cleanup policy
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Required for deduplication.
- B. Required to group writes atomically.
- C. Required to avoid reading uncommitted data.
- D. Correct — cleanup policy is unrelated to EOS.
```

## Question 11

```markdown
What happens if a Kafka producer uses `transactional.id` but does NOT enable idempotence?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It works, but with reduced performance
- B. The producer logs a warning and continues
- C. Kafka throws an exception and shuts down the producer
- D. Kafka enables idempotence automatically
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. EOS requires idempotence; no fallback behavior.
- B. It does not continue with warnings.
- C. Kafka does not throw an error; it self-corrects.
- D. Correct — enabling `transactional.id` automatically enables idempotence.
```

## Question 12

```markdown
Which Kafka feature ensures that multiple writes across different partitions are committed atomically?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Idempotence
- B. Producer batching
- C. Transactions
- D. Consumer groups
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Idempotence only handles duplicates, not atomicity.
- B. Batching improves throughput but not atomicity.
- C. Correct — transactions provide atomic writes across topics/partitions.
- D. Consumer groups handle load balancing, not atomicity.
```
