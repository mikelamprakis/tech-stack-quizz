## Question 1

```markdown
How does Kafka Streams achieve exactly-once processing?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. By committing offsets before processing
- B. By using changelog topics and transactional writes
- C. By relying on producer idempotence alone
- D. By avoiding repartitioning steps
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Offsets must be committed only after successful processing.
- B. Correct — Kafka Streams uses transactions to group state store updates and output topic writes atomically.
- C. Idempotence is necessary but not sufficient for EOS.
- D. Repartitioning can still be used safely with EOS.
```

- D. To log committed transactions
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Offsets are tracked in internal offset topics.

## Question 3

```markdown
In Kafka Streams, what does the processing guarantee `exactly_once_v2` improve compared to `exactly_once`?
```

**Options**

```markdown

- C. Disables changelog topics
- D. Forces all topics to be compacted
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown

- D. exactly_once_v2
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. at_least_once was the earlier default.
- B. none is not a valid processing guarantee in Streams.
- C. exactly_once was the previous guarantee before v2.
- D. Correct — exactly_once_v2 is the default from Kafka 3.0 onward.
```

## Question 5

```markdown
Which two components does Kafka Streams synchronize using transactions to achieve EOS?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Source topics and changelogs
- B. Offset commits and external DB writes
- C. State store updates and output topic writes
- D. Serde configurations and repartitioning
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Source topics are read-only; changelogs are write destinations.
- B. External DBs are not transactional participants in Streams.
- C. Correct — both must succeed or fail together for exactly-once guarantees.
- D. Serdes and repartitioning do not require transactions.
```

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown
What is one **key advantage** of `exactly_once_v2` over `exactly_once`?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It disables state store usage
- B. It requires fewer brokers to function
- C. It uses fewer producer instances and fewer RPCs
- D. It eliminates the need for commit intervals
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. State stores are still used.
- B. Broker requirements remain unchanged.
- C. Correct — v2 improves performance by reducing producer count and network overhead.
- D. Commit intervals are still relevant for flushing.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
When is a Kafka Streams record considered "processed" under exactly-once guarantees?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. After it's read from the source topic
- B. After it's transformed but before being stored
- C. After state updates and output writes are committed in a transaction
- D. As soon as it's added to the RocksDB state store
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Reading doesn't imply success.
- B. Transformation alone isn't sufficient — transactional commit is key.
- C. Correct — processing is considered done only after atomic commit of both state and output.
- D. RocksDB is updated locally, but EOS requires commit confirmation.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
How does Kafka Streams recover a stateful application after failure?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. By reading the input topic from the beginning
- B. By rebuilding state stores from changelog topics
- C. By inspecting consumer group metadata
- D. By polling transaction logs
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Input topics are not sufficient to recover intermediate state.
- B. Correct — changelog topics mirror state store updates and are replayed for recovery.
- C. Group metadata tracks offsets, not application state.
- D. Transaction logs are internal to brokers and not used for state recovery.
```

</details>

## Question 9

```markdown
What happens if a Kafka Streams application crashes **after** processing but **before** committing a transaction?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The output and state are still applied
- B. Only output topics are rolled back
- C. The entire transaction is aborted; no partial writes are visible
- D. The changelog topics continue updating
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Transactions ensure nothing is applied until committed.
- B. Both output and state are part of the same transaction.
- C. Correct — uncommitted transactions are aborted on failure.
- D. Changelog updates are transactional and thus also rolled back.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
Which of the following scenarios would break EOS in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Improper state store recovery
- B. Using exactly_once_v2 with compacted topics
- C. Flushing RocksDB periodically
- D. Using standby replicas for state recovery
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Correct — if state recovery fails or is inconsistent, EOS is compromised.
- B. Compacted topics are fine for changelogs.
- C. Flushing is normal and doesn’t break EOS.
- D. Standby replicas help ensure EOS during failover.
```

## Question 11

```markdown
What does it mean when Kafka Streams says “state and output are committed atomically”?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The source offset is committed to the changelog
- B. Output messages and changelog updates are part of a single transaction
- C. RocksDB and Serde configs are backed up together
- D. All records are flushed before repartitioning
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Offset tracking is internal to the Streams engine.
- B. Correct — the state and output must both succeed or fail together to ensure EOS.
- C. Serde configs are unrelated to commit logic.
- D. Repartitioning isn’t directly related to transactional commits.
```

## Question 12

```markdown
How are output topic writes synchronized with state updates in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. They are written to different producers
- B. They are coordinated via the consumer group leader
- C. They are wrapped in a single transaction per task
- D. They use two-phase commit across brokers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Streams uses a single transactional producer per task.
- B. The group leader handles partition assignment, not write coordination.
- C. Correct — each task wraps its writes and state changes into a single transaction.
- D. Kafka does not use classic two-phase commit.
```
