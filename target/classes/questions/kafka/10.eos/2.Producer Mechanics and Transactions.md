## Question 1

```markdown
What happens when you set `enable.idempotence=true` in the Kafka producer config?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will never retry failed sends
- B. The producer guarantees at-most-once delivery
- C. The producer ensures no duplicate writes due to retries
- D. The producer disables batching
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Retries are still allowed and recommended.
- B. Idempotence supports at-least-once or exactly-once, not at-most-once.

- D. max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=10
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. acks=0 disables reliability — transactions require stronger guarantees.

```

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Transactions can span multiple partitions and topics.

- C. Correct — transactions must be either committed or aborted explicitly.

## Question 4

```markdown
What does the transaction coordinator do in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Ensures partitions are compacted after transactions
- B. Manages transaction state and fencing
- C. Balances messages across partitions
- D. Tracks consumer offsets
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Log compaction is unrelated to transaction coordination.
- B. Correct — the coordinator manages transaction lifecycle and fencing logic.
- C. Producers assign partitions; the coordinator doesn't.
- D. Consumer group coordinators track offsets, not the transaction coordinator.
```

## Question 5

```markdown
Which configuration setting helps prevent out-of-order delivery in idempotent producers?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. batch.size
- B. linger.ms
- C. max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=1
- D. buffer.memory
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. batch.size affects performance, not ordering guarantees.
- B. linger.ms delays batching, not ordering.
- C. Correct — this avoids the chance of earlier retries completing after later sends.
- D. buffer.memory controls memory usage, not message ordering.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
Why is the `transactional.id` important in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It defines the topic name for storing transactions
- B. It helps the broker detect and fence zombie producers
- C. It sets the number of partitions to use in a transaction
- D. It guarantees zero-copy writes
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Transactions aren’t tied to topics by ID.
- B. Correct — the broker uses `transactional.id` with producer epoch to fence old producers.
- C. Partition count is not controlled via transactional ID.
- D. Zero-copy is a performance feature, not a transactional one.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
What does "fencing" mean in the context of Kafka producer transactions?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Preventing duplicate consumer group subscriptions
- B. Blocking old producer instances from committing transactions
- C. Dropping old messages during compaction
- D. Encrypting data during transaction commits
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Consumer groups are unrelated to producer fencing.
- B. Correct — fencing prevents outdated producers from interfering with current ones.
- C. Log compaction is unrelated to fencing.
- D. Encryption is not part of fencing logic.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
Which of the following is the correct sequence of operations for a transactional Kafka producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. send → commit → beginTransaction
- B. beginTransaction → send → commitTransaction
- C. send → beginTransaction → flush
- D. commitTransaction → send → flush
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. The transaction must begin before sending.
- B. Correct — the correct order is: beginTransaction, send, then commitTransaction.
- C. Sending should occur within a transaction, not before it.
- D. Committing before sending makes no sense.
```

## Question 9

```markdown
What happens if a producer crashes after sending messages but before committing the transaction?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The messages will be immediately visible to all consumers
- B. The messages will be permanently lost
- C. The transaction will be aborted and messages won't be visible to `read_committed` consumers
- D. The messages will remain visible even if the transaction is incomplete
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Not true — messages are invisible until committed.
- B. Messages are not lost; they're just not delivered.
- C. Correct — uncommitted messages are aborted and skipped by read_committed consumers.
- D. `read_committed` ensures only committed messages are visible.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
Which property must be set to enable retry logic in a Kafka producer?

- D. linger.ms
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

- B. acks=0 disables retries from being effective.
- C. Idempotence allows safe retries but does not control retry count.
- D. linger.ms affects batching latency, not retries.
```

- B. enable.idempotence=true
- C. acks=0
- D. batch.size=0
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Compression has no impact on EOS.
- B. Correct — idempotence is a foundational requirement for EOS.
- C. acks=0 breaks all delivery guarantees.

## Question 12

What is the main purpose of producer epochs in Kafka?
