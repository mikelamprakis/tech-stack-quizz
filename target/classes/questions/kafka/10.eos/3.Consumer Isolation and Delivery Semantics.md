## Question 5

```markdown
Which of the following best describes the purpose of `read_uncommitted`?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Guarantees exactly-once delivery
- B. Excludes all transactional messages
- C. Allows consumers to see all records, even if uncommitted
- D. Delays record visibility until the transaction commits
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. `read_uncommitted` risks duplicate or aborted records — no EOS.
- B. It includes all transactional messages, not excludes.
- C. Correct — all messages are visible regardless of transaction state.
- D. That’s true for `read_committed`.
```

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown
In which scenario would a Kafka consumer **receive duplicate records** under normal operation?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. When using `read_committed` with manual offset commits
- B. When re-consuming from a committed offset after a failure
- C. When using transactions and EOS
- D. When idempotence is enabled on the consumer
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. `read_committed` helps avoid duplicates, assuming commits are used correctly.
- B. Correct — after a failure, re-reading from the last committed offset can reprocess messages.
- C. EOS prevents duplicates with correct config.
- D. Consumers don’t have an `idempotence` config — only producers do.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
Which Kafka feature prevents a consumer from processing messages from an **aborted** transaction?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Offsets being stored in Kafka
- B. Producer fencing
- C. Consumer groups
- D. Setting `isolation.level=read_committed`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Offset storage is unrelated to filtering aborted messages.
- B. Producer fencing prevents stale writes, not consumer reads.
- C. Consumer groups handle partition assignment, not filtering.
- D. Correct — `read_committed` skips aborted transactional messages.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
In Kafka Connect, how can sink connectors benefit from `read_committed`?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. By filtering tombstone records
- B. By skipping corrupted messages
- C. By ensuring only committed data is written to external systems
- D. By reducing lag in high-throughput topics
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Tombstones are a result of compaction, not transactions.
- B. Message corruption is unrelated to isolation level.
- C. Correct — using `read_committed` ensures only finalized messages are written externally.
- D. `read_committed` may slightly increase lag, not reduce it.
```

## Question 9

```markdown
Which of the following scenarios risks breaking EOS at the consumer side?

- D. Setting max.poll.records to a low number
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. This is the recommended EOS configuration.
- B. Correct — `read_uncommitted` can expose aborted data, breaking EOS guarantees.
- C. Compaction affects retention, not EOS.
- D. Poll batch size doesn’t affect EOS directly.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
What must a consumer do to ensure exactly-once delivery **when integrated with Kafka transactions**?

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Automatic offset commits may occur before processing finishes.
- B. `enable.auto.commit=true` often causes at-least-once delivery, not EOS.
- C. Correct — committing only after successful processing ensures EOS.
- D. `read_uncommitted` breaks transactional visibility.
```

## Question 11

- C. EOS is not supported in Streams
- D. Changelogs are only for compaction, not EOS
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. State stores are critical for EOS in Streams.
