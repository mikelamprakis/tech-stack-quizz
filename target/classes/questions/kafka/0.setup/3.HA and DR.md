## Question 2

```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Both regions serve traffic simultaneously
- B. The passive region takes over after failover
- C. The system automatically restarts the active region
- D. No failover occurs because only Active/Active supports it
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Only one region is active at a time.
- B. Correct: Passive becomes active during failover.
- C. Incorrect: Restarting doesn't guarantee recovery.
- D. Incorrect: Active/Passive setups are explicitly designed for failover.
```

## Question 3

```markdown
Which of the following is a major disadvantage of Active/Active replication?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Increased recovery time
- B. Infrastructure waste
- C. Complex conflict resolution
- D. Downtime during failover
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Active/Active actually reduces recovery time.
- B. Incorrect: Infra is used in both regions, not wasted.
- C. Correct: Handling bi-directional writes may lead to data conflicts.
- D. Incorrect: There is no downtime in failover; that’s a strength of Active/Active.
```

## Question 4

```markdown
Which Kafka-native tool is recommended for cross-cluster topic replication?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Kafka Streams
- B. Kafka Connect JDBC
- C. MirrorMaker 2.0
- D. Replicator.py
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Kafka Streams is for in-stream processing, not replication.
- B. Incorrect: JDBC connector is for databases.
- C. Correct: MirrorMaker 2.0 is designed for Kafka-to-Kafka replication.
- D. Incorrect: Not a standard Kafka tool.
```

## Question 5

```markdown
What is a best practice when backing up metadata in a Kafka DR strategy?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Only back up topic names
- B. Use Schema Registry snapshots only
- C. Store configs and schemas in version control
- D. Disable ACLs to simplify failover
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: You must include configs, not just names.
- B. Incorrect: Snapshots are helpful but not complete.
- C. Correct: Version control of configs/schemas ensures reproducible DR.
- D. Incorrect: Disabling ACLs weakens security and isn’t recommended.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
Which metrics are most important when evaluating DR effectiveness?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. CPU usage and disk space
- B. Replication factor and retention period
- C. RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- D. Number of consumer groups
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Important for tuning, but not DR-specific.
- B. Incorrect: Part of HA, but not DR metrics.
- C. Correct: RTO and RPO measure time to recover and data loss tolerance.
- D. Incorrect: Not a primary DR metric.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
Why is simulating node or AZ failure important in DR planning?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It increases throughput during recovery
- B. It helps validate real-world recovery behavior
- C. It disables auto-rebalancing
- D. It prevents schema changes during outages
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Simulations are for planning, not performance boosts.
- B. Correct: Real DR drills test your failover mechanisms and reveal weaknesses.
- C. Incorrect: Rebalancing remains active unless explicitly disabled.
- D. Incorrect: DR simulations don’t impact schema operations.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
Which configuration ensures Kafka can continue functioning if a broker fails?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. replication.factor=1
- B. min.insync.replicas=1
- C. replication.factor=3 and min.insync.replicas=2
- D. retention.ms=0
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: A single replica offers no fault tolerance.
- B. Incorrect: Only one in-sync replica is risky during failures.
- C. Correct: 3 replicas with 2 in-sync ensures availability during one-broker failure.
- D. Incorrect: Retention period doesn’t affect availability.
```

## Question 9

```markdown
What is a common reason to prefer Cross-AZ over Cross-Region replication in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Higher throughput
- B. Better support for legacy clients
- C. Lower replication latency
- D. Cheaper storage costs
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Throughput depends more on partitioning and network.
- B. Incorrect: Replication type doesn’t impact client support.
- C. Correct: Cross-AZ replication offers lower latency than cross-region.
- D. Incorrect: Storage costs are unaffected by replication topology.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
You are developing a disaster recovery plan for a Kafka deployment that needs to ensure data availability and reliability during outages. What considerations are crucial for effective disaster recovery planning in Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Ensuring all data is stored in a single location.
- B. Prioritizing low-cost storage solutions.
- C. Replicating data across multiple data centers or availability zones.
- D. Focusing solely on backup frequency.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Disaster recovery planning for Kafka should include strategies to replicate data across multiple locations to ensure availability during outages. This involves setting up replication across multiple data centers or availability zones, backing up critical metadata, and regularly testing failover and failback procedures to ensure reliability.
```
