## Question 1

```markdown
Which of the following best explains the difference between `listeners` and `advertised.listeners` in Kafka broker configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `listeners` is for consumers, `advertised.listeners` is for producers
- B. Both control the internal broker port for ZooKeeper
- C. `listeners` defines where the broker binds, `advertised.listeners` defines what clients connect to
- D. `advertised.listeners` is only used when SSL is enabled
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: These settings are not split by producer/consumer role.
- B. Incorrect: They are unrelated to ZooKeeper.
- C. Correct: `listeners` is where the broker binds locally; `advertised.listeners` is what clients see and connect to.
- D. Incorrect: This setting applies regardless of whether SSL is used.
```

## Question 2

```markdown
What is one of the key reasons to choose Kafka's KRaft mode over ZooKeeper mode?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. KRaft mode uses less disk space
- B. KRaft mode supports older Kafka clients
- C. KRaft mode eliminates the need for an external metadata service
- D. KRaft mode increases partition throughput
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Disk space usage isn't a main differentiator.
- B. Incorrect: Compatibility is unrelated to KRaft mode.
- C. Correct: KRaft mode allows Kafka to manage metadata internally without ZooKeeper.
- D. Incorrect: Partition throughput depends on other factors like disk and memory.
```

## Question 3

```markdown
What filesystem is recommended for Kafka log storage to support high throughput and low latency?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. NTFS
- B. ext4
- C. NFS
- D. SMB
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: NTFS is not commonly used in Linux-based Kafka deployments.
- B. Correct: `ext4` (and XFS) supports direct I/O and sequential writes, ideal for Kafka.
- C. Incorrect: NFS adds latency and consistency problems.
- D. Incorrect: SMB is a networked filesystem unsuitable for Kafka logs.
```

## Question 4

```markdown
Which of the following is a **common pitfall** when running Kafka inside Docker?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Using multiple partitions on a single topic
- B. Setting log retention to 1 day
- C. Binding listeners to 127.0.0.1
- D. Configuring multiple brokers in a cluster
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: This is normal and not a problem.
- B. Incorrect: Log retention is configurable and not inherently a pitfall.
- C. Correct: Binding to localhost can prevent other containers or external clients from accessing the broker.
- D. Incorrect: This is standard in a Kafka cluster.
```

## Question 5

```markdown
Why should Kafka log data be stored on a dedicated disk in production?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To avoid corrupting ZooKeeper data
- B. To prevent the OS from slowing down Kafka
- C. To reduce I/O contention and improve write throughput
- D. To enable faster garbage collection in the JVM
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: ZooKeeper uses separate configuration and data paths.
- B. Incorrect: The OS performance is not directly related to log storage.
- C. Correct: Using a dedicated disk helps isolate Kafka I/O and improves performance under load.
- D. Incorrect: JVM garbage collection is unrelated to disk storage location.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
What protocol does Kafka use for messaging communications?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. UDP
- B. TCP
- C. HTTP
- D. FTP
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

## Question 7

```markdown
How does the publish/subscribe model work specifically in Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Producers push messages directly to consumers
- B. Producers publish messages without knowing the consumers
- C. Consumers push messages directly to producers
- D. Consumers request messages as needed from producers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In Kafka's publish/subscribe model, producers publish messages to topics without needing to be aware of the consumers, who subscribe to these topics to receive messages.
```

## Question 8

```markdown
What is the primary purpose of Apache Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. To build real-time streaming data pipelines
