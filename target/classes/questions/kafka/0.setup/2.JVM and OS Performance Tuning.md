## Question 7

```markdown
How can you improve Kafka producer throughput by leveraging Kafka’s I/O model?

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Incorrect: Auto commit affects consumers, not producers.
- B. Incorrect: Too many small partitions reduce sequential write efficiency.
- C. Correct: Larger batches and slight delays allow Kafka to perform large sequential writes, improving disk throughput.
- D. Incorrect: NFS is discouraged due to latency and consistency issues.

## Question 9

```markdown
You are managing a Kafka cluster that is experiencing periodic slowdowns during high-throughput periods. You suspect that JVM garbage collection might be the cause. How would you adjust the JVM settings to potentially reduce these GC-related slowdowns?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Switch to a low-pause garbage collector like G1GC to reduce disruption during high-throughput periods.
- B. Decrease the heap size to force more frequent garbage collections, ensuring that each collection is quicker.
- C. Enable real-time garbage collection to prevent any pauses.
- D. Increase the JVM heap size to provide more memory for objects before garbage collection is triggered.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A, D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In this scenario, the periodic slowdowns during high-load periods could be mitigated by:

Increasing the JVM heap size, which can allow more objects to reside in memory before triggering a garbage collection, potentially reducing the frequency of GC events.

Switching to a garbage collector that focuses on minimizing pause times, such as the G1 Garbage Collector (G1GC). G1GC is designed to better support systems requiring large heaps and high-throughput, offering more predictable garbage collection pauses by working concurrently with application threads.
