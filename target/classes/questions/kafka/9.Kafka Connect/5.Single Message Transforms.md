**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. SMTs are not focused on security.
- B. They don’t perform analytics.

## Question 11

```markdown  
A retail chain wants to integrate sales data from their Point of Sale (POS) systems across multiple stores into Kafka for real-time analysis and inventory management. Each store's POS system dumps sales records into a local SQL database. The integration needs to account for network bandwidth limitations. Which strategy optimally addresses these requirements?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. Deploy Kafka Connect with the JDBC Source Connector at each store to ingest sales data into Kafka, using Single Message Transforms (SMTs) to filter and reduce the size of the data on the fly. Aggregate this data centrally using a Kafka Streams application for inventory analysis  
- B. Utilize log-based Change Data Capture (CDC) connectors to monitor changes in each store's SQL database, streaming only new or changed sales records into Kafka. This minimizes network usage and enables real-time central processing with Kafka Streams  
- C. Implement custom Kafka Producers within the POS systems to directly publish sales data to Kafka, compressing messages to mitigate network bandwidth issues. Use Kafka Streams for processing and inventory management centrally  
- D. Set up a central database to aggregate sales data from all stores nightly. Use the JDBC Sink Connector to transfer this aggregated data into Kafka for next-day inventory analysis, relying on batch processing rather than real-time analysis  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
CDC provides efficient, incremental data transfer.  

- A. Full data transfer may strain bandwidth  
- B. Correct. Only transfers changes, minimizing bandwidth  
- C. Custom solution increases maintenance  
- D. Batch processing doesn't meet real-time needs  
```  

</details>  


## Question 12

```markdown
A company needs to filter out sensitive data from logs before storing it in a database using Kafka Connect. Which Kafka Connect feature should be utilized to achieve this?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Kafka Streams API.
- B. Stream joins.
- C. Schema management.
- D. Single Message Transforms (SMTs).
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Single Message Transforms (SMTs) in Kafka Connect allow for the modification of records as they pass through the pipeline, suitable for tasks like filtering sensitive data.
```
