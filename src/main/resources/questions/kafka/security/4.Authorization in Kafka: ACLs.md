Here are 15 challenging questions based on the "Authorization in Kafka: ACLs" document, designed to simulate the real Kafka certification exam:

---

## Question 1

```markdown
What is the primary purpose of Kafka ACLs?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. To encrypt data in transit
- B. To authenticate client identity
- C. To authorize access to Kafka resources
- D. To compress message payloads
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
ACLs (Access Control Lists) are used to authorize access to Kafka resources like topics, groups, and clusters. Encryption is handled by SSL, and authentication is managed by SASL.

- A. Incorrect: Encryption is handled by SSL/TLS.
- B. Incorrect: Authentication is handled by SASL.
- C. Correct: ACLs control authorization.
- D. Incorrect: Compression is unrelated to ACLs.
```

</details>

## Question 2

```markdown
Which of the following is NOT a valid Kafka resource type for ACLs?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Topic
- B. Group
- C. Cluster
- D. ZooKeeper
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
ZooKeeper is not a resource type for Kafka ACLs. Valid resource types include Topic, Group, Cluster, TransactionalID, and DelegationToken.

- A. Incorrect: Topic is a valid resource type.
- B. Incorrect: Group is a valid resource type.
- C. Incorrect: Cluster is a valid resource type.
- D. Correct: ZooKeeper is not a Kafka ACL resource.
```

</details>

## Question 3

```markdown
Which command-line tool is used to manage Kafka ACLs?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. kafka-topics.sh
- B. kafka-acls.sh
- C. kafka-configs.sh
- D. kafka-console-producer.sh
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `kafka-acls.sh` tool is specifically designed for managing ACLs in Kafka. The other tools are used for topics, configurations, and producing messages.

- A. Incorrect: Used for topic operations.
- B. Correct: The tool for managing ACLs.
- C. Incorrect: Used for broker/topic configurations.
- D. Incorrect: Used for producing messages.
```

</details>

## Question 4

```markdown
Which action would you grant to allow a client to produce messages to a topic?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. READ
- B. WRITE
- C. DESCRIBE
- D. DELETE
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `WRITE` action allows a client to produce messages to a topic. `READ` is for consuming, and `DESCRIBE` is for metadata access.

- A. Incorrect: READ allows consuming, not producing.
- B. Correct: WRITE allows producing.
- C. Incorrect: DESCRIBE allows metadata access.
- D. Incorrect: DELETE allows topic deletion.
```

</details>

## Question 5

```markdown
What is the correct order of Kafka's security layers?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. ACLs → SASL → SSL
- B. SSL → SASL → ACLs
- C. SASL → SSL → ACLs
- D. SSL → ACLs → SASL
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka's security layers are: SSL (encryption), SASL (authentication), and ACLs (authorization). Each layer builds on the previous one.

- A. Incorrect: Incorrect order.
- B. Correct: SSL → SASL → ACLs is the correct sequence.
- C. Incorrect: Incorrect order.
- D. Incorrect: Incorrect order.
```

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown
Which of the following commands grants a user READ access to all topics with the prefix "dev-"?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. `--topic dev- --operation READ`
- B. `--topic dev- --operation READ --resource-pattern-type literal`
- C. `--topic dev- --operation READ --resource-pattern-type prefixed`
- D. `--topic '*' --operation READ`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `--resource-pattern-type prefixed` flag ensures the ACL applies to all topics starting with "dev-". A literal match would only apply to a topic named exactly "dev-".

- A. Incorrect: Missing resource-pattern-type.
- B. Incorrect: Literal matches only exact names.
- C. Correct: Prefixed matches all "dev-" topics.
- D. Incorrect: Wildcard matches all topics, not just "dev-".
```

</details>

## Question 7

```markdown
A client is authenticated but cannot consume messages from a topic. What is the most likely issue?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Missing WRITE permission on the topic
- B. Missing READ permission on the topic or group
- C. Missing DESCRIBE permission on the cluster
- D. Missing CREATE permission on the topic
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Consuming requires READ permission on the topic and the consumer group. WRITE is for producing, and DESCRIBE/CREATE are unrelated.

- A. Incorrect: WRITE is for producing.
- B. Correct: READ is required for consuming.
- C. Incorrect: DESCRIBE is for metadata, not consumption.
- D. Incorrect: CREATE is for topic creation.
```

</details>

- C. Disable ACLs for internal networks
- D. Use only DESCRIBE permissions for producers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The principle of least privilege ensures users have only the permissions they need. Wildcard permissions and disabling ACLs are insecure.

- A. Incorrect: Wildcards can overexpose resources.
- B. Correct: Least privilege is a security best practice.
- C. Incorrect: ACLs should always be enabled.
- D. Incorrect: Producers need WRITE, not just DESCRIBE.
```

## Question 22

```markdown
A producer application in a developer machine was able to send messages to a Kafka topic.  
After copying the producer application into another developer's machine,  
the producer is able to connect to Kafka but unable to produce to the same Kafka topic because of an authorization issue.  
What is the likely issue?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The kafka broker needs to be rebooted
- B. The Kafka ACL does not allow another machine IP.
- C. Broker configurations needs to be changed to allow a different producer
- D. The topic is restricted to the original producer only
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka ACLs include a "Host" field, which can be a wildcard (*) or a specific IP address.
If the producer works on one machine but fails on another, it's likely the ACL only allows the first machine’s IP.

- A. Rebooting the broker has no effect on ACLs.
- B. Correct – ACLs may be IP-specific, and a different machine means a different IP.
- C. Broker configs don’t control specific producer access like this.
- D. Kafka does not restrict topics to specific producer instances by default.
```
