## Question 1

```markdown  
What is the primary purpose of a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in Kafka Connect?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. To store successfully processed records for auditing  
- B. To act as a buffer for high-throughput data  
- C. To store failed records for later analysis or reprocessing  
- D. To replace the main topic when it is full  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
A DLQ is specifically designed to capture records that fail processing, enabling debugging and recovery.  

- A. Successfully processed records are stored in the destination system or output topic.  
- B. Buffering is handled by Kafka topics, not DLQs.  
- C. Correct. DLQs isolate failed records for troubleshooting.  
- D. DLQs do not replace main topics; they complement them.  
```

## Question 2

```markdown  
Which configuration property enables a sink connector to continue processing despite errors?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. `retry.backoff.ms`  
- B. `errors.tolerance`  
- C. `max.retries`  
- D. `errors.log.enable`  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
`errors.tolerance` set to `"all"` allows the connector to skip or route errors to a DLQ without failing.  

- A. `retry.backoff.ms` controls retry delays but does not enable error tolerance.  
- B. Correct. This property determines whether to tolerate errors.  
- C. `max.retries` limits retry attempts but does not override `errors.tolerance`.  
- D. `errors.log.enable` logs errors but does not affect processing continuity.  
```  

</details>

## Question 3

```markdown  
What metadata is included in a DLQ record besides the original payload?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. Timestamp of the Kafka cluster startup  
- B. Error headers (e.g., `ERROR_CLASS`, `ERROR_MESSAGE`)  
- C. The IP address of the Connect worker  
- D. The number of retries attempted  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
DLQ records include error headers for debugging, such as the exception class and message.  

- A. Cluster startup time is irrelevant to failed records.  
- B. Correct. Headers provide context about the failure.  
- C. Worker IP is not part of the DLQ record.  
- D. Retry count is not explicitly stored in the DLQ.  
```  

</details>

## Question 4

```markdown  
Which retry configuration determines the initial delay between retry attempts?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. `max.retries`  
- B. `errors.retry.timeout`  
- C. `retry.backoff.ms`  
- D. `errors.tolerance`  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
`retry.backoff.ms` defines the initial (and often exponential) delay between retries.  

- A. `max.retries` sets the maximum number of attempts.  
- B. `errors.retry.timeout` sets the total retry window.  
- C. Correct. This property controls the retry delay.  
- D. `errors.tolerance` enables/disables error handling.  
```  

</details>

## Question 5

```markdown  
What happens when `errors.tolerance` is set to `"none"`?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. The connector ignores all errors silently.  
- B. The connector fails on the first error encountered.  
- C. The connector retries indefinitely.  
- D. The connector routes all errors to a DLQ automatically.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
`"none"` is the default mode, causing the connector to fail immediately on any error.  

- A. Silently ignoring errors requires `"all"` mode.  
- B. Correct. This is the default behavior.  
- C. Retry behavior is controlled separately.  
- D. DLQ routing requires explicit configuration.  
```  

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown  
Which of the following is a valid use case for a DLQ?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. Storing records that were processed successfully  
- B. Handling temporary network outages  
- C. Capturing records with schema mismatches  
- D. Increasing topic replication factor  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
DLQs are designed for unrecoverable errors like schema mismatches or invalid data.  

- A. Successfully processed records do not belong in a DLQ.  
- B. Network outages are typically handled by retries, not DLQs.  
- C. Correct. Schema mismatches are a common DLQ use case.  
- D. Replication factor is a topic configuration, unrelated to DLQs.  
```

## Question 7

```markdown  
How can you enable error metadata headers in DLQ records?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. Set `errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable` to `"true"`.  
- B. Configure `errors.log.enable` to `"true"`.  
- C. Use `retry.backoff.ms` with a value of `0`.  
- D. Set `max.retries` to `1`.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
This property explicitly enables error headers in DLQ records for debugging.  

- A. Correct. This configuration adds error context to headers.  
- B. `errors.log.enable` logs errors but does not affect DLQ headers.  
- C. `retry.backoff.ms` controls retry delays, not headers.  
- D. `max.retries` limits attempts but does not enable headers.  
```

## Question 8

```markdown  
Which command checks the contents of a DLQ topic named `users_dlq`?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. `kafka-topics --describe --topic users_dlq`  
- B. `kafka-console-consumer --topic users_dlq --from-beginning`  
- C. `kafka-configs --entity-type topics --entity-name users_dlq`  
- D. `kafka-producer-perf-test --topic users_dlq`  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
The console consumer reads records from the specified topic, including DLQs.  

- A. This describes the topic but does not show records.  
- B. Correct. This command reads DLQ records.  
- C. This manages topic configurations, not data.  
- D. This is a performance testing tool, not for inspection.  
```  

</details>

## Question 9

```markdown  
What is the default value of `errors.tolerance` in Kafka Connect?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. `"all"`  
- B. `"none"`  
- C. `"retry"`  
- D. `"log"`  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
By default, connectors fail on the first error (`"none"` mode).  

- A. `"all"` must be explicitly configured.  
- B. Correct. This is the default strict mode.  
- C. `"retry"` is not a valid value.  
- D. `"log"` is not a valid value.  
```  

</details>

## Question 10

```markdown  
Why are DLQs less commonly used for source connectors?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. Source connectors cannot produce invalid data.  
- B. Errors in source connectors are always retried indefinitely.  
- C. Source connectors typically log errors instead of using DLQs.  
- D. DLQs are only supported for sink connectors.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
Source connectors often log errors (via `errors.log.enable`) since they pull data rather than push it.  

- A. Source connectors can produce invalid data (e.g., parsing failures).  
- B. Retry behavior depends on configuration, not connector type.  
- C. Correct. Logging is the preferred method for source connectors.  
- D. DLQs can be used for both, but are more common in sinks.  
```
