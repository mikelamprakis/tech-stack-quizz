## Question 1

```markdown
Why does Kafka Streams trigger repartitioning?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. When records are filtered
- B. When records are transformed with a stateless map
- C. When operations require key-based grouping or joining with mismatched partitions
- D. When a topic is compacted
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Repartitioning happens when operations (like groupByKey or joins) require aligned partitions and key distribution.

- A. Filtering doesn’t affect key distribution.
- B. Stateless operations don’t need repartitioning.
- C. Correct.
- D. Compaction is unrelated.
```

## Question 2

```markdown
Which type of Kafka Streams operation often causes automatic repartitioning?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `filter()`
- B. `mapValues()`
- C. `groupBy()` with a custom key selector
- D. `peek()`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Custom `groupBy()` changes the key, and Kafka Streams needs to repartition based on the new key.

- A. Doesn’t affect keys.
- B. mapValues changes only value.
- C. Correct.
- D. peek is non-transforming.
```

```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. A changelog topic
- B. An output topic
- C. A repartition topic
- D. A source topic
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams automatically creates internal **repartition topics** to align partitioning.

- A. Changelog topics are for state stores.
- B. Output topics are defined by the developer.
- C. Correct.
- D. Source topics are external.
```

</details>

## Question 4

```markdown
What is the naming convention for an internal repartition topic?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. __internal-<app-id>-repartition
- B. <app-id>-<name>-repartition
- C. __changelog-<store-name>
- D. <app-id>-output
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Repartition topics follow the `<application-id>-<repartition-node-name>-repartition` pattern.

- A. Incorrect format.
- B. Correct.
- C. That’s for changelog topics.
- D. That’s an output topic, not internal.
```

## Question 5

```markdown
What is the purpose of a changelog topic in Kafka Streams?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To store the results of repartitioning
- B. To persist the output of joins

- D. To replicate Kafka producer logs
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Changelog topics back up state stores for failover and restoration.

- A. Repartitioning uses different topics.

## Question 6

```markdown
When does Kafka Streams NOT require a repartition topic for a join?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. When both streams are grouped by the same key
- B. When a KStream joins a KTable
- C. When joining streams with mismatched keys
- D. When using `map()` before the join
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
KStream-KTable joins don’t require repartitioning because the KTable is already keyed.

- A. Still might require repartitioning depending on upstream keys.
- B. Correct.
- C. Repartitioning required here.
- D. map() doesn’t fix key mismatches.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
Which of the following is true about internal topics in Kafka Streams?
```

- C. They are automatically managed by Kafka Streams
- D. They require ACL configuration by default
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams automatically manages the lifecycle of internal topics like changelogs and repartitions.

- A. No need to create manually.
- B. Usually not consumed by external consumers.
- C. Correct.
- D. Only if security is enabled.
```

</details>

## Question 8

```markdown
What could happen if internal repartition topics are deleted manually?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Kafka Streams will recreate them seamlessly
- B. The Streams app might crash or lose data integrity
- C. Kafka will redirect to backup partitions
- D. Nothing; they are optional
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Internal topics are essential to Kafka Streams logic. Deleting them can break the processing.

- A. Recreating is not guaranteed.
- B. Correct.
- C. Kafka doesn’t reroute automatically.
- D. Not optional.
```

## Question 9

```markdown
What replication factor do internal topics use by default?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 3
- D. It depends on cluster configuration
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
By default, internal topics are created with a replication factor of 3 (if the cluster supports it).

- A. Too low for fault tolerance.
- B. Not default.
- C. Correct.
- D. It may fall back if 3 replicas aren’t available, but the default is 3.
```

## Question 10

- D. Source topics are managed externally.
```

</details>

## Question 11

```markdown
In a Kafka cluster, two topics, `TopicA` and `TopicB`, are configured to be co-partitioned. This means they have an identical number of partitions, and messages in corresponding partitions are related to each other. Given the following configurations for these topics:

- `TopicA` has 6 partitions.
- `TopicB` is configured with the same number of partitions as `TopicA`.
- Both topics are consumed by a single consumer group with the `max.poll.records` configuration set to 500.

Assuming that the consumer processes messages from both topics in a manner that maintains their relationship, what is a critical consideration for ensuring data consistency across these co-partitioned topics?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Same replication.factor
- B. Custom partitioner with same key
- C. More partitions for TopicB
- D. Increase max.poll.records
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
To maintain alignment between co-partitioned topics, it's critical that related messages go to the same partition in both topics. A custom partitioner using the same key ensures consistent partitioning across topics.

- A. While replication.factor improves durability, it doesn’t guarantee message alignment.
- B. Correct. Ensures related records go to the same partition in both topics.
- C. Wrong. Unequal partitions break co-partitioning.
- D. Irrelevant to data consistency between topics.
```

</details>

## Question 12

```markdown
For a streaming application processing data from two co-partitioned topics, `TopicX` and `TopicY`, which configuration ensures that the stream processing application maintains message ordering and correlation between these topics?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. log.compaction = true
- B. Consume in separate threads
- C. Unique consumer group per topic
- D. Same key + same consumer group
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
To maintain correlation and ordering between related messages in co-partitioned topics, they must share the same key and be consumed within the same group.

- A. Compaction is irrelevant here.
- B. Separate threads may cause disorder.
- C. Multiple groups lead to uncoordinated consumption.
- D. Correct. Same key + same group maintains message pairing.
```

</details>

## Question 13

```markdown
In Kafka Streams, by what value are internal topics (like repartition or changelog topics) prefixed?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. application.id
- B. kafka-streams
- C. group.id
- D. bootstrap.servers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka Streams uses the `application.id` to namespace all internal topics and state stores.

- A. application.id – Correct; used as prefix for internal topic names and consumer group ID.
- B. kafka-streams – Not used as a prefix.
- C. group.id – Internally derived from application.id but not used as a prefix.
- D. bootstrap.servers – Not related to topic naming.
```
