## Question 1

```markdown
Which of the following Kafka Streams operations is stateless?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. map()
- B. aggregate()
- C. reduce()
- D. count()
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Stateless operations do not require maintaining any intermediate state.

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`filter()` evaluates a predicate and discards records that return false.

- B. No record
- C. One or more records
- D. Aggregated record
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`flatMap()` is used to emit zero or more output records per input.

- A. That's `map()`.
- B. Possible, but not always.
- C. Correct.
- D. Aggregation is unrelated.
```

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown
Which of the following is **not** a stateless operation?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. selectKey()
- B. groupBy()
- C. filter()
- D. mapValues()
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`groupBy()` groups records and initiates stateful aggregations.

- A. Stateless key transformation.
- B. Correct – triggers repartitioning and state.
- C. Stateless.
- D. Stateless value transformation.
```

</details>

---

## Question 7

```markdown
What does `mapValues()` operate on?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Only the key
- B. Only the value
- C. Both key and value
- D. Just the timestamp
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`mapValues()` changes the value while keeping the key unchanged.

- A. Key remains untouched.
- B. Correct.
- C. Use `map()` for both.
- D. Timestamp isn’t involved here.
```

</details>

## Question 8

```markdown
What is the result of using `selectKey()` in a stream?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Drops the message
- B. Changes the key of the message
- C. Changes the value of the message
- D. Partitions the stream
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`selectKey()` allows you to derive a new key from each record.

- A. Records are kept.
- B. Correct.
- C. Use `mapValues()` for this.
- D. Repartitioning can happen **after** key change.
```

</details>

## Question 9

```markdown
Which operation is best for sending data to a side system without modifying the record?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. flatMap()
- B. peek()
- C. map()
- D. filter()
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`peek()` lets you inspect or act on a record without altering the stream.

- A. Emits multiple records.
- B. Correct – perfect for logging, metrics, etc.
- C. Changes records.
- D. Filters records.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
Which stateless Kafka Streams operation is most suitable for branching a stream?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. map()
- B. split()
- C. filter()
- D. groupByKey()
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`split()` allows you to branch a stream into multiple sub-streams based on predicates.

- A. Transforms records.
- B. Correct.
- C. Only keeps or drops records.
- D. Used for aggregation, not branching.
```

</details>

## Question 11

```markdown
What is the recommended way to enhance the performance of a Kafka Streams application that does a simple map transformation on the input data?
```
**Options**

```markdown
- A. Increase the number of partitions of the output topic
- B. Enable state store caching
- C. Increase the commit interval
- D. Disable logging
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka Streams application that performs a simple stateless transformation like `map`, the bottleneck is often in the processing of the output topic. Increasing the number of partitions of the output topic allows more consumer instances to read from the topic in parallel, thereby increasing the overall throughput.

- B is not applicable because state store caching is useful for stateful operations, not for stateless transformations like `map`.
- C is incorrect because increasing the commit interval can actually decrease performance by causing larger batches to accumulate before being processed.
- D is incorrect because disabling logging does not directly enhance performance and can make debugging more difficult.

## Question 4

```markdown
What are the functions of flatMapValues and branch operations in Kafka Streams? (Select all that apply)
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. flatMapValues: Aggregates values across different keys
- B. branch: Merges multiple streams into one
- C. flatMapValues: Transforms each input record into multiple output records
- D. branch: Filters records into multiple streams based on predicates
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answers:** C, D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Key differences:
- C. Correct: flatMapValues "flattens" one-to-many
- D. Correct: branch splits streams via predicates
- A. Incorrect: Aggregation uses reduce/aggregate
- B. Incorrect: Merging uses merge()
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>
