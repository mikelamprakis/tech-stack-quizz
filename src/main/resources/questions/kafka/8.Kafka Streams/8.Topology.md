## Question 10

```markdown
What is one reason Kafka Streams might auto-generate internal topics in a topology?

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Internal topics are created for:

- Repartitioning (to ensure correct key distribution)
- Changelogging (for state recovery)

## Question 11

```markdown
In a Kafka Streams application, where are the processing topology configurations stored?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. In a special Kafka topic named `streams-configs`
- B. In Zookeeper under the `/kafka-streams` znode
- C. In the Kafka Streams application code itself
- D. In a separate config file read by the Kafka Streams application
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
In a Kafka Streams application, the processing topology (the DAG of processing nodes) is defined in the application code itself using the Kafka Streams DSL or the Processor API.

- A, B are incorrect because Kafka Streams does not use a special topic or Zookeeper for storing topology configurations.
- D is incorrect as the topology is not defined in a separate config file, but rather in the application code.
```
