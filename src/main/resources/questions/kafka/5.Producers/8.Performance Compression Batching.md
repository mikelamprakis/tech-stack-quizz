## Question 1

```markdown
What is the primary trade-off between throughput and latency in Kafka producers?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Higher throughput reduces CPU usage
- B. Lower latency increases batch size
- C. Higher throughput increases latency
- D. Lower latency reduces network overhead
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The primary trade-off is that higher throughput requires larger batches or waiting (`linger.ms`), which increases latency. Conversely, low latency sends messages immediately, reducing throughput.

- A. Incorrect: CPU usage is unrelated to this trade-off.
- B. Incorrect: Lower latency uses smaller batches or no batching.
- C. Correct: Larger batches or waiting for `linger.ms` increases throughput but also latency.
- D. Incorrect: Network overhead is higher with low latency (smaller batches).
```

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`linger.ms` determines the time the producer waits for additional messages to fill a batch.

- A. Incorrect: `batch.size` sets the maximum size of a batch in bytes.
- B. Incorrect: `buffer.memory` controls the total memory for buffering messages.

```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
When the buffer is full, the producer either blocks (up to `max.block.ms`) or throws a `BufferExhaustedException`.
