## Question 1
```markdown  
What is the minimum number of in-sync replicas (ISR) required to maintain write availability when `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=2` for a topic with `replication.factor=3`?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. 1 (only the leader)  
- B. 2 (leader + 1 follower)  
- C. 3 (all replicas)  
- D. Write availability is impossible with these settings  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. `min.insync.replicas=2` requires at least 2 replicas (leader + 1 follower).  
- B. **Correct.** The leader counts toward ISR, so 1 follower must also be in sync.  
- C. All replicas need not be in sync for writes to succeed.  
- D. Availability is maintained as long as ISR ≥ `min.insync.replicas`.  
```  
</details>

## Question 2
```markdown  
How does Kafka handle replication when a follower replica falls out of the ISR due to slow disk I/O?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. The follower is permanently removed from the replica set.  
- B. The follower continues to replicate but is excluded from leader election until it catches up.  
- C. The controller triggers a partition reassignment to replace the slow follower.  
- D. Producers begin routing writes directly to the lagging follower to speed up recovery.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. Replicas are only removed if the broker fails permanently.  
- B. **Correct.** Followers outside ISR continue fetching data but cannot become leaders.  
- C. Reassignment is manual; Kafka does not auto-replace replicas.  
- D. Producers only write to the leader.  
```  
</details>  

---

## Question 3
```markdown  
What happens if a broker hosting a partition leader fails and `unclean.leader.election.enable=false` while no ISR replicas are available?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. The partition becomes read-only until an ISR replica recovers.  
- B. Producers receive `NotEnoughReplicasException` for writes.  
- C. Kafka automatically reduces `min.insync.replicas` to 1.  
- D. The oldest out-of-sync replica is promoted to leader.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. Partitions are never read-only; they become unavailable for writes.  
- B. **Correct.** Writes fail to ensure consistency when no ISR exists.  
- C. `min.insync.replicas` cannot be dynamically adjusted.  
- D. Only allowed if `unclean.leader.election.enable=true`.  
```  
</details>  

---

## Question 4
```markdown  
Why does Kafka use a pull-based replication model (followers fetch from leaders) instead of push-based?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. To allow followers to control their own fetch rates and avoid overwhelming slow brokers.  
- B. Because ZooKeeper cannot support push-based replication.  
- C. To ensure messages are compressed before replication.  
- D. Because TCP push semantics are incompatible with Kafka's protocol.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. **Correct.** Pull-based replication lets followers manage their load and catch up at their own pace.  
- B. ZooKeeper is unrelated to replication mechanics.  
- C. Compression happens before data reaches the leader, not during replication.  
- D. Kafka's protocol is agnostic to TCP push/pull.  
```  
</details>

- B. To control how often followers ping the controller.  
- C. To limit the duration of unclean leader elections.  
- D. To define the timeout for producer acknowledgments.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. **Correct.** Followers exceeding this lag are excluded from ISR.  
- B. Heartbeats are controlled by `zookeeper.session.timeout.ms` (ZooKeeper) or KRaft quorum settings.  
- C. Unclean elections are binary (`enable/disable`), not time-based.  
- D. Producer timeouts use `delivery.timeout.ms`.  
```  
</details>  

---

## Question 6
```markdown  
How does Kafka ensure durability when `acks=all` and one ISR replica crashes mid-write?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. The write fails, and producers must retry.  
- B. The leader stores the message in a temporary buffer until the replica recovers.  
- C. The write succeeds once the remaining ISR replicas acknowledge it.  
- D. ZooKeeper temporarily stores the message until replication completes.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. Writes succeed as long as `min.insync.replicas` is met.  
- B. Kafka has no temporary buffers for unacknowledged writes.  
- C. **Correct.** `acks=all` only requires acknowledgment from current ISR members.  
- D. ZooKeeper is not involved in message replication.  
```  
</details>

## Question 7
```markdown  
What is a risk of enabling `unclean.leader.election.enable` in KRaft mode?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. It corrupts the `@metadata` topic.  
- B. It allows out-of-sync replicas to become metadata leaders, risking inconsistency.  
- C. It disables the controller quorum entirely.  
- D. It forces ZooKeeper to take over metadata duties.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. This setting affects data partitions, not metadata.  
- B. **Correct.** While rare, this could allow stale metadata to propagate.  
- C. The quorum remains active.  
- D. ZooKeeper is inactive in KRaft.  
```  
</details>

## Question 8
```markdown  
What happens to messages produced with `acks=1` if the leader crashes immediately after acknowledging them but before replicating to followers?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. The messages are lost permanently.  
- B. The messages are recovered from the producer's buffer upon leader recovery.  
- C. The messages are reconstructed from ZooKeeper metadata.  
- D. Followers automatically fetch the messages from producers.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. **Correct.** `acks=1` only guarantees leader persistence; unreplicated messages are lost if the leader crashes.  
- B. Producer buffers are cleared after acknowledgment.  
- C. ZooKeeper does not store message content.  
- D. Followers only fetch from leaders, not producers.  
```

- B. It allows unclean elections but only if at least 2 out-of-sync replicas exist.  
- C. It has no effect on unclean leader election behavior.  
- D. It forces the controller to wait for 2 replicas to sync before allowing elections.  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
```markdown  
- A. `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` overrides this safety check.  
- B. Unclean elections consider any out-of-sync replica, regardless of count.  
- C. **Correct.** The settings are independent; `min.insync.replicas` only affects producers.  
- D. The controller does not wait for syncs if unclean elections are enabled.  
```  
</details>

## Question 10
```markdown  
What is the purpose of the `LeaderEpoch` in Kafka's replication protocol?  
```
