### ‚úÖ **1. Core Concepts & Guarantees**

Focus: Understanding what EOS really means in Kafka ‚Äî conceptually and practically.

**Topics to include:**

* Difference between *idempotence*, *transactions*, and *EOS*
* At-most-once vs At-least-once vs Exactly-once
* Common misconceptions (e.g., EOS includes external DB writes)

---

### üîÑ **2. Producer Mechanics & Transactions**

Focus: How producers achieve EOS through idempotence and transactions.

**Topics to include:**

* `enable.idempotence`, `transactional.id`, `acks`, `retries`
* Transaction boundaries: begin, commit, abort
* Producer fencing and transactional guarantees
* Role of transaction coordinator

---

### üîç **3. Consumer Isolation & Delivery Semantics**

Focus: How consumers handle transactional data and achieve EOS from their side.

**Topics to include:**

* `isolation.level=read_committed` vs `read_uncommitted`
* Behavior of consumers when reading from topics with aborted transactions
* Implications for Kafka Streams or Connect consumers

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **4. EOS in Kafka Streams (Optional Swap)**

(You can include this instead of "Consumer Isolation" if you‚Äôre targeting stream processing developers.)

**Topics to include:**

* How Streams uses transactions and changelogs
* Exactly-once vs exactly-once-v2 processing guarantees
* How state stores and output topics are coordinated
