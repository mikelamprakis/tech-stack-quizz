## Question 1

```markdown
What is the primary purpose of Kafka ACLs?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. To encrypt data in transit
- B. To authenticate client identity
- C. To authorize access to Kafka resources
- D. To compress message payloads
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

- B. kafka-acls.sh
- C. kafka-configs.sh
- D. kafka-console-producer.sh
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `kafka-acls.sh` tool is specifically designed for managing ACLs in Kafka. The other tools are used for topics, configurations, and producing messages.

- A. Incorrect: Used for topic operations.

**Options**
```markdown
- A. READ
- B. WRITE
- C. DESCRIBE
- D. DELETE
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `WRITE` action allows a client to produce messages to a topic. `READ` is for consuming, and `DESCRIBE` is for metadata access.

- A. Incorrect: READ allows consuming, not producing.
- B. Correct: WRITE allows producing.
- C. Incorrect: DESCRIBE allows metadata access.
- D. Incorrect: DELETE allows topic deletion.
```

</details>

- C. SASL → SSL → ACLs
- D. SSL → ACLs → SASL
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

- C. Incorrect: Incorrect order.
- D. Incorrect: Incorrect order.
```

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown
Which of the following commands grants a user READ access to all topics with the prefix "dev-"?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. `--topic dev- --operation READ`
- B. `--topic dev- --operation READ --resource-pattern-type literal`
- C. `--topic dev- --operation READ --resource-pattern-type prefixed`
- D. `--topic '*' --operation READ`
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `--resource-pattern-type prefixed` flag ensures the ACL applies to all topics starting with "dev-". A literal match would only apply to a topic named exactly "dev-".

- A. Incorrect: Missing resource-pattern-type.
- B. Incorrect: Literal matches only exact names.
- C. Correct: Prefixed matches all "dev-" topics.
- D. Incorrect: Wildcard matches all topics, not just "dev-".
```

</details>

---

## Question 7

```markdown
A client is authenticated but cannot consume messages from a topic. What is the most likely issue?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Missing WRITE permission on the topic
- B. Missing READ permission on the topic or group
- C. Missing DESCRIBE permission on the cluster
- D. Missing CREATE permission on the topic
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Consuming requires READ permission on the topic and the consumer group. WRITE is for producing, and DESCRIBE/CREATE are unrelated.

- A. Incorrect: WRITE is for producing.
- B. Correct: READ is required for consuming.
- C. Incorrect: DESCRIBE is for metadata, not consumption.
- D. Incorrect: CREATE is for topic creation.
```

</details>

- C. Disable ACLs for internal networks
- D. Use only DESCRIBE permissions for producers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The principle of least privilege ensures users have only the permissions they need. Wildcard permissions and disabling ACLs are insecure.

- A. Incorrect: Wildcards can overexpose resources.
- B. Correct: Least privilege is a security best practice.
- C. Incorrect: ACLs should always be enabled.
- D. Incorrect: Producers need WRITE, not just DESCRIBE.
```

</details>

- A. Incorrect: Broker address is unrelated.
- B. Correct: Defines the user/service for the ACL.
- C. Incorrect: SSL is configured separately.
- D. Incorrect: Replication factor is a topic setting.
```

</details>

- D. To encrypt data in transit
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

- B. Correct: TransactionalID is for exactly-once semantics.
- C. Incorrect: Topic creation is controlled via `CREATE`.
- D. Incorrect: Encryption is handled by SSL.
```

</details>

## Question 16

```markdown
A producer application in a developer machine was able to send messages to a Kafka topic.  
After copying the producer application into another developer's machine,  
the producer is able to connect to Kafka but unable to produce to the same Kafka topic because of an authorization issue.  
What is the likely issue?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The kafka broker needs to be rebooted
- B. The Kafka ACL does not allow another machine IP.
- C. Broker configurations needs to be changed to allow a different producer
- D. The topic is restricted to the original producer only
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka ACLs include a "Host" field, which can be a wildcard (*) or a specific IP address.
If the producer works on one machine but fails on another, it's likely the ACL only allows the first machine’s IP.

- A. Rebooting the broker has no effect on ACLs.
- B. Correct – ACLs may be IP-specific, and a different machine means a different IP.
- C. Broker configs don’t control specific producer access like this.
- D. Kafka does not restrict topics to specific producer instances by default.
```
