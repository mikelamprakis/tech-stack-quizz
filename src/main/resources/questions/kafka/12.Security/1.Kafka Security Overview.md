## Question 1

```markdown
Which of the following is NOT a core pillar of Kafka's security model?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Encryption (SSL/TLS)
- B. Authentication (SASL + SSL)
- C. Authorization (ACLs)
- D. Data compression (Snappy)
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The three core pillars of Kafka security are encryption (SSL/TLS), authentication (SASL + SSL), and authorization (ACLs). Data compression (Snappy) is unrelated to security.

- A. Incorrect: SSL/TLS is a core pillar for encryption.
- B. Incorrect: SASL + SSL is a core pillar for authentication.
- C. Incorrect: ACLs are a core pillar for authorization.
- D. Correct: Data compression is not part of Kafka's security model.
```

## Question 2

```markdown
In KRaft mode, which component no longer needs to be secured?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Brokers
- B. ZooKeeper
- C. Clients
- D. Producers
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
KRaft mode removes the dependency on ZooKeeper, simplifying security by eliminating the need to secure ZooKeeper communication.

- A. Incorrect: Brokers still need to be secured.
- B. Correct: ZooKeeper is no longer used in KRaft mode.
- C. Incorrect: Clients still need authentication/encryption.
- D. Incorrect: Producers are clients and still need security.
```

## Question 3

```markdown
What is the primary risk of not enabling Kafka security?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Increased CPU usage
- B. Data leakage or poisoning
- C. Slower message throughput
- D. Incompatibility with ZooKeeper
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Without security, Kafka is vulnerable to data leakage (unauthorized reads), data poisoning (malicious writes), and destruction (deletion of topics/messages).

- A. Incorrect: CPU usage is a trade-off of enabling security.
- B. Correct: Data leakage/poisoning is the primary risk.
- C. Incorrect: Throughput is unrelated to security risks.
- D. Incorrect: ZooKeeper compatibility is unaffected.
```

## Question 4

```markdown
Which of the following is a benefit of enabling Kafka security?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Elimination of all latency overhead
- B. Simplified credential management
- C. Compliance with data protection regulations
- D. Automatic topic deletion
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Security ensures compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). It does not reduce latency, simplify credentials, or delete topics.

- A. Incorrect: Latency increases slightly.
- B. Incorrect: Credential management becomes more complex.
- C. Correct: Security enables compliance.
- D. Incorrect: Topic deletion is unrelated.
```

## Question 5

```markdown
What is the main advantage of KRaft mode over ZooKeeper in terms of security?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Eliminates the need for SSL/TLS
- B. Removes the need to secure ZooKeeper communication
- C. Simplifies ACL management
- D. Reduces CPU usage
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
KRaft mode removes ZooKeeper, simplifying security by eliminating one component to secure. SSL/TLS and ACLs are still required.

- A. Incorrect: SSL/TLS is still needed.
- B. Correct: ZooKeeper communication no longer exists.
- C. Incorrect: ACL management remains similar.
- D. Incorrect: CPU usage is not directly affected.
```

## Question 6

```markdown
Which of the following is a valid use case for Kafka security?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. Protecting banking transaction data
- B. Increasing message throughput
- C. Reducing topic replication factor
- D. Disabling consumer groups
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Security is critical for sensitive data like banking transactions. The other options are unrelated to security.

- A. Correct: Security protects sensitive data.
- B. Incorrect: Throughput is unrelated to security.
- C. Incorrect: Replication factor is a performance setting.
- D. Incorrect: Consumer groups are a core feature, not security-related.
```

## Question 7

```markdown
Which component is NOT part of Kafka's security layers?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. SSL
- B. SASL
- C. ACLs
- D. ZooKeeper
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
ZooKeeper is for coordination, not security. The three security layers are SSL, SASL, and ACLs.

- A. Incorrect: SSL is a security layer.
- B. Incorrect: SASL is a security layer.
- C. Incorrect: ACLs are a security layer.
- D. Correct: ZooKeeper is unrelated to security layers.
```
