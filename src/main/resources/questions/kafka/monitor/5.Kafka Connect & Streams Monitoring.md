## Question 16

```markdown
How can the `client.id` setting be useful in monitoring and troubleshooting Kafka clients?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. It allows setting different configuration parameters for each client
- B. It enables tracking and correlating client activity in logs and metrics
- C. It determines the partitioning strategy used by the client
- D. It specifies the maximum number of connections the client can establish
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `client.id` setting enables tracking and correlating client activity in logs and metrics. By assigning a unique ID to each client, it's easier to identify their behavior and troubleshoot performance or connectivity issues.

- A. Incorrect – configuration parameters are set via other properties, not `client.id`.
- B. Correct – it helps correlate logs and metrics to specific clients.
- C. Incorrect – partitioning strategy is configured separately (e.g., via partitioner class).
- D. Incorrect – `client.id` does not control connection limits.
```
